/**
 * A curated entry shown in the model catalog. Carries everything needed to
 * one-click create a fully-configured managed model — including pricing and
 * per-param specs — plus a small amount of presentation metadata for the card.
 *
 * NOTE — **the model card is the primary source for rates.** Each model's page
 * in the Bedrock User Guide publishes its full rate card (per inference option
 * and context window) alongside caching support, context windows, service
 * tiers and endpoint support:
 *
 *   docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-card-<provider>-<model>.html
 *
 * Check it first — the cards carry context windows, caching support,
 * parameter tables and cutoffs, none of which any pricing API publishes.
 *
 * **But corroborate the RATES against the Price List API.** As of 2026-09-21
 * it carries almost everything, and a rate worth shipping should agree in
 * both. There are two offer files, and picking the wrong one is the trap:
 *
 *   # Claude, Cohere, Palmyra, TwelveLabs, Luma, Stability  (372 SKUs)
 *   aws pricing get-products --region us-east-1 \
 *     --service-code AmazonBedrockFoundationModels \
 *     --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=regionCode,Value=us-west-2
 *
 *   # Nova, xAI, Google, DeepSeek, Qwen, Moonshot             (1052 SKUs)
 *   aws pricing get-products --region us-east-1 \
 *     --service-code AmazonBedrock \
 *     --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=regionCode,Value=us-west-2
 *
 * ⚠️ An earlier revision of this comment said the API returns "10 Claude
 * SKUs, none newer than Claude 3". **That is no longer true**, and the lesson
 * is the failure mode rather than the fact: a query against the wrong offer
 * file, or one filtering on the now-removed `model` attribute, returns zero
 * and reads exactly like an unpublished model. Re-verified 2026-09-21 — every
 * Claude row below is present and matches its card to the cent (Haiku 4.5
 * $1.10/$5.50 Regional, $1.00/$5.00 Global; Sonnet 4.6 $3.30/$16.50; Opus 4.7
 * $5.50/$27.50; Sonnet 5 $2.00/$10.00 Global; Fable 5.1 $10/$50 Global with a
 * $0.25 cache read that independently confirms its 0.025x multiplier).
 *
 * The product schema now exposes only regionCode, usagetype, location,
 * servicename and operation — there is no `model` and no `tokenType`. Match on
 * `servicename` in the FoundationModels file ("Claude Haiku 4.5 (Amazon
 * Bedrock Edition)") and on `usagetype` in the AmazonBedrock one
 * ("USW2-moonshotai.kimi-k3-mantle-input-tokens-standard").
 *
 * Newer models publish `*_tokens_standard` usagetypes; older ones publish
 * `*TokenCount`. Both shapes are live TODAY in the same file — Sonnet 5 and
 * Opus 4.7 use the first, Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.6 the second — so a query
 * written for one silently returns nothing for the other. Match both.
 *
 * The one real gap: the **hosted OpenAI family** (`openai.gpt-5.4`,
 * `us.openai.gpt-5.6-*`, `us.openai.gpt-6-astra`) is absent from BOTH offer
 * files, so its cards remain the only source. Reading that absence as
 * "unpublished" once put three rows into the dev catalog at GovCloud prices,
 * over-charging by 20%. Note the old explanation for it — "those models bill
 * through AWS Marketplace, which no pricing API covers" — is wrong: Claude's
 * rows are `MP:` Marketplace usagetypes and are covered. Only `gpt-oss`, the
 * open-weight family, appears; the hosted GPT models genuinely do not.

/**
 * The OpenAI family on `bedrock-runtime` via the Responses API.
 *
 * Rates are the **Geo CRIS, Short Context (272K)** row from each model card —
 * Geo CRIS is the tier the `us.*` inference profiles resolve to, and these
 * models are inference-profile-only (no ON_DEMAND). Verified 2026-09-06,
 * re-verified for GPT-6 Astra 2026-09-11.
 *
 * **Every card in this family publishes two price tables, and the tier is
 * selected by the ACTUAL token count of the request** — not by a declared
 * window, and not by a separate model id. Settled 2026-09-11 (see
 * `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md`): the Price List API encodes `-long-ctx` as a
 * value of `tokenType` under an identical `model` attribute, GPT-5.6 Terra
 * declares a 1M window against a single model id yet still publishes a
 * reachable Short Context table, and our own Cost Explorer rows bill
 * `_standard` and never `-long-ctx` while calling those 1M-window ids. There
 * is no field in which a window could be declared: `maxInputTokens` below is
 * ours, is read only for compaction and telemetry, and never reaches a
 * Bedrock request.
 *
 * That is exactly why `maxInputTokens: 272_000` is load-bearing. It does not
 * protect us from being over-charged — nothing here does. It keeps the single
 * flat rate per bucket that `CuratedModel` can hold **arithmetically true**,
 * because a request that crosses 272K bills input at 2x, output at 1.5x and
 * both cache buckets at 2x. Raising it silently UNDER-charges every long turn.
 *
 * `supportedParams` was deliberately absent here until 2026-09-12, when it was
 * MEASURED — the bar this comment has always set. AWS still publishes no
 * parameter table for these models (`model-parameters-openai.html` documents
 * only the open-weight gpt-oss family), so the evidence is the endpoint's own
 * responses, probed against all four ids in us-west-2:
 *
 *   - `reasoning.effort` — sending a deliberately invalid value returns a 400
 *     that ENUMERATES the enum: "Supported values are: 'none', 'low',
 *     'medium', 'high', 'xhigh', and 'max'." Identical on Sol, Terra, Luna and
 *     Astra, and it matches the launch blog ("They also support none, low,
 *     medium, high, xhigh, and max reasoning effort"). Two independent sources.
 *   - `temperature` and `top_p` — hard 400 on all four: "Unsupported
 *     parameter: 'temperature' is not supported with this model."
 *   - `max_output_tokens` — accepted.
 *
 * That last pair is why declaring a spec here is a FIX, not just an enabler.
 * With no spec the #915 guard stays permissive, so a `temperature` reaching
 * this family from any caller that can set one kills the turn with a 400
 * mid-stream. Declaring them `supported: false` drops them before the request
 * instead — the same failure class the guard inversion was written to close on
 * Claude Opus 4.7.
 *
 * `reasoning_effort` defaults to `medium`, which was also measured rather than
 * assumed. Neither the cards nor the blog publish a default, so the question
 * was what the provider does when the param is ABSENT — which is not the same
 * as sending `none`. Sending nothing still reasons; `none` is an explicit
 * "off". Three samples per level on Luna, in reasoning tokens:
 *
 *     unset  285 / 516 / 327   (mean 376)
 *     none     0 /   0 /   0
 *     low    221 / 222 / 230   (mean 224)
 *     medium 274 / 346 / 303   (mean 308)
 *     high   516 / 363 / 497   (mean 459)
 *
 * So the implicit default already sits around medium, and declaring `medium`
 * is cost-neutral-to-slightly-cheaper (-18% reasoning tokens), NOT an increase.
 * It is declared anyway because otherwise the provider can move its own
 * default and our spend follows with no code change and no signal — and
 * because a declared default is what lets the picker show the level in force
 * instead of a blank row. Counts are noisy (unset spanned 285-516 across three
 * identical calls), so treat the middle levels as roughly interchangeable.
 *
 * The level that actually moves the bill is `max`: ~2.3x the output tokens of
 * unset on Terra, and reasoning bills as output. It stays in `allowed`
 * deliberately — dropping a level from that list is the lever if the exposure
 * is ever unwanted, since the picker and the backend both read it.
 *
 * GPT-6 Astra inherits this default by sharing the helper. Its effort ENUM was
 * probed directly, but its token counts were not — medium there is an
 * extrapolation from its GPT-5.6 siblings, not a measurement.
 *
 * The standing rule is unchanged — a declared spec flips the guard from
 * permissive to restrictive, so a wrong entry silently blocks a parameter the
 * model really accepts. Add or widen one only from published or measured
 * evidence, and re-probe rather than assume when a new sibling ships.

/**
 * Moonshot AI's Kimi K3, curated onto `bedrock-responses` rather than `bedrock`.
 *
 * It is a `bedrock-runtime` model that Converse can call, so the obvious home
 * is `CURATED_BEDROCK_MODELS` alongside Claude. Its model card rules that out
 * on three counts, and names our own framework while doing it:
 *
 *   1. **Converse breaks multi-turn.** "a failure (`InternalServerException`)
 *      when reasoning content from earlier turns is included in a multi-turn
 *      request, which affects frameworks such as LangChain and Strands Agents
 *      in their default configurations." That is our agent loop, in its
 *      default configuration, on turn two.
 *   2. **Converse gets no explicit caching.** Explicit prompt caching is
 *      "Responses and Chat Completions APIs only" — a `bedrock` row would
 *      route over Converse and reach only implicit caching, and our whole
 *      `cachePoint` contract is Converse-shaped and would place nothing.
 *   3. **Converse rejects documents.** "rejection of attached document inputs
 *      such as PDF and HTML." Attachments are ~31% of prod spend; a model that
 *      silently refuses them is not a general chat default.
 *
 * `bedrock-mantle` is not an option either — the card's endpoint table marks it
 * unsupported, unlike the `openai.*` and `qwen.*` rows in
 * {@link CURATED_MANTLE_MODELS}.
 *
 * That leaves `bedrock-responses`, which is where it belongs anyway: the same
 * transport, the same per-request bearer mint, and the same implicit caching
 * the GPT-5.6 family already rides. `supportsCaching: true` is inherited and
 * correct — Kimi K3 caches implicitly by default with no way to turn it off,
 * so `false` would zero the cache rates while AWS billed them.
 *
 * **Two family defaults are deliberately overridden**, and both are pricing:
 *
 * - `maxInputTokens: 1_000_000`. The 272K pin on
 *   {@link bedrockResponsesDefaults} is load-bearing *for the OpenAI family*,
 *   which publishes two price cards selected by actual token count. Kimi K3
 *   publishes ONE table per inference option — there is no second card to fall
 *   into — so the single flat rate stays arithmetically true across the whole
 *   1M window, and inheriting 272K would only compact early for no reason.
 * - `providerName: 'Moonshot AI'`. The family default is `'OpenAI'`, which is
 *   the transport's origin, not this model's vendor.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Cost note on images.** The card: the `detail` parameter that trades
 * image fidelity for cost "is honored only on the Chat Completions API. On the
 * Responses API, images are always processed at high detail." This row routes
 * over Responses (the provider forces `apiMode`), so every image is billed at
 * high detail with no lever. Text and cached prefixes are unaffected.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Caching needs the explicit path on this model, and that is a backend
 * carve-out, not a field here.** Its card says it "supports implicit
 * (automatic) prompt caching" by default. Measured clean-room 2026-09-21
 * (dev-ai, unique prefix per arm, 10.5k prefix, 4 turns) the default bills a
 * cache WRITE every turn and reads one back never — $0.17338, against $0.13872
 * for the same turns UNCACHED. Stock caching is 25% worse than no caching.
 * Full explicit (`prompt_cache_options` + a breakpoint) costs $0.05401, a 69%
 * saving. `_EXPLICIT_CACHE_REQUIRED_MODELS` in
 * `apis/shared/models/bedrock_responses.py` forces that path for this model id
 * regardless of the transport-wide env flag, which stays off for GPT-5.6 where
 * explicit measured 57% WORSE. The rates below are only correct because of it.
 *
 * **`us.` not `global.`, and that is an environment constraint, not a
 * preference.** Global CRIS is cheaper ($3.00 / $15.00 vs $3.30 / $16.50), but
 * dev-ai sits under Control Tower SCP `p-r61tynkc`, which explicitly denies
 * `bedrock:InvokeModel` on EVERY `global.*` profile — verified 2026-09-21
 * against `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`
 * as well as this model, while the `us.*` sibling of each works. Curating the
 * Global id would put a model in the picker that 401s on first use in dev. The
 * prod account is in no organization, so no SCP applies there — if this row is
 * ever promoted, `global.moonshotai.kimi-k3` at $3.00 / $15.00 is the cheaper
 * and correct id.
 *
 * Rates are the **US CRIS** column: $3.30 / $16.50, cache read $0.33 (0.1x)
 * and cache write $4.125 (1.25x) — both exactly the derived multipliers, so
 * {@link ratesWithDerivedCache} carries it without an override. **Two
 * independent sources agree to the cent**: the model card, and the Price List
 * API's `AmazonBedrock` offer file (`USW2-moonshotai.kimi-k3-mantle-*-standard`
 * usagetypes). Note the second one is the `AmazonBedrock` service code, NOT
 * `AmazonBedrockFoundationModels` — Moonshot, xAI, Google and Nova all live
 * there, and a query against the other offer file returns nothing for them.
