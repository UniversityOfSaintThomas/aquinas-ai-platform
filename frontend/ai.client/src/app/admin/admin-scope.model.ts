/**
 * Delegated admin scopes — the client mirror of
 * `apis/shared/rbac/admin_scopes.py`.
 *
 * A scope names one admin feature area that a system admin can delegate to
 * another role. `system_admin` holds every scope implicitly.
 *
 * The ids are duplicated here as a literal union rather than fetched, because
 * route definitions and nav items need them at build time and a typo in a route
 * `data: { scope }` would otherwise fail open-ended at runtime. The registry
 * *metadata* (labels, groups, descriptions) is still served by
 * `GET /admin/roles/admin-scopes` — this file is only the identifier contract.
 * `admin-scope.model.spec.ts` is the reminder to keep both ends in step.
