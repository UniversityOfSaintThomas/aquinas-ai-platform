 *

 * - `preparing`   the agent is being BUILT — tool registry, MCP pre-flight,
 *                 session restore. Emitted by the chat route rather than the
 *                 status hook, because it happens before the event loop (and
 *                 before `message_start`) exists. Measured at 1478ms on a cold
 *                 agent-cache miss and 0-38ms warm, so in practice it appears
 *                 only when it is worth appearing. Carries no `cycle`.
 * - `prepared`    that build FINISHED, carrying its measured `durationMs`.
 *                 Its whole job is to end `preparing`. Without it the SPA
 *                 could only infer the end from `thinking`, which does not
 *                 arrive until the head-of-turn work and the event loop's
 *                 startup have run too — so a 1ms cache-hit build still
 *                 rendered "Getting ready…". A phase that is only ever the
 *                 "latest event" cannot express a wait that ended.
 * - `thinking`    the model is generating (one per event-loop cycle, so a
 *                 three-tool turn reports it four times — that IS the turn's
 *                 shape, and `cycle` distinguishes them)
 * - `tool_start`  a specific tool began executing
 * - `tool_end`    it finished; carries the Strands-measured `durationMs` and
 *                 whether it succeeded
 *
 * There is deliberately no "responding" phase: the SPA already knows text is
 * streaming because the deltas are arriving. A backend-derived duplicate of a
 * fact the client holds first-hand would only disagree at the edges.
 *
 * Gated by `AGENT_STATUS_ENABLED` (default on with a kill switch); `preparing`
 * rides its own `AGENT_PREPARING_PHASE_ENABLED`, since deferring the build
 * into the stream is a change to the turn path rather than to narration.
