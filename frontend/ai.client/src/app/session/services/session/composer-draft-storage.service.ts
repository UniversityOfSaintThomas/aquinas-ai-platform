/**
 * Everything a user has composed but not sent, remembered per conversation
 * across navigation and reloads: the text, the `@`-mention bound to it, the
 * follow-ups queued behind a streaming turn, and the files attached to it.
 *
 * Distinct from {@link ComposerDraftService}, which is a one-shot *hand-off*:
 * a feature pushes text at the composer for the user to edit. This is the
 * opposite direction — the composer parks what the user built and takes it
 * back when they return to that conversation.
 *
 * `localStorage`, not memory: the losses worth preventing are the ones the
 * user did not choose — a reload, a closed tab, a session expiry bouncing
 * through Cognito — and an in-memory map survives none of them. The key for
 * the new-conversation composer is a constant ({@link NEW_CONVERSATION_DRAFT_KEY}),
 * so staging a file upload (which mints a session id before the first send)
 * does not move the draft out from under it.
 *
 * One `localStorage` entry per conversation rather than one JSON file of all
 * of them: two tabs sitting in different conversations then never overwrite
 * each other's drafts, and no write has to parse every other draft first.
 * Two tabs in the *same* conversation still race, last write winning — which
 * is the behaviour a single draft slot can offer, and each tab's own composer
 * is untouched while it is open.
 *
 * **Nothing stored here is trusted.** Attachment metadata is a display cache
 * so the cards paint without waiting on a round trip; the upload ids are
 * pointers the server re-checks against the signed-in user on both the
 * reconcile (`GET /files?sessionId=`) and the send (`FileResolver` keys on
 * `USER#{userId}`), so a tampered entry resolves to no file.
 *
 * Storage is best-effort throughout. A blocked or full `localStorage` (private
 * windows, a storage-disabled browser, quota) loses the draft and nothing
 * else — every call swallows its own failure rather than taking the composer
 * down with it.
