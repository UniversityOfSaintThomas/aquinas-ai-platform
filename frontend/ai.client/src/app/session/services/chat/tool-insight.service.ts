 * downgrade every rail from the model's prose to the deterministic formatter,
 * with no way to recover short of a hard refresh.
 *
 * Reads are scoped to a conversation so a `toolUseId` can only resolve inside
 * the conversation that produced it. Writes carry their own session id: the
 * streaming session is not necessarily the viewed one, and a background
 * conversation's insights should be there when the user navigates back.
 *
 * Durations are deliberately NOT persisted server-side. They are cheap to
 * re-derive as a nicety and worthless as a historical record — a reloaded
 * conversation shows summaries without timings, which reads fine, where a
 * duration invented on the client would be a number the user could not trust.
