  /**
   * Send one turn of an embedded preview — the agent designer's live preview,
   * the marketplace reviewer's test drive — through the SAME path a real chat
   * turn takes.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A SEPARATE SERVICE:
   * The preview used to own a parallel `PreviewChatService` that re-implemented
   * the SSE consumer. It handled 9 of the ~27 events `processStreamEvent`
   * dispatches, and every callback in that core is optional — so an event with
   * no handler is a silent no-op, not an error. The ones it dropped included
   * `tool_approval_required` and `oauth_required`, which is to say: a tool call
   * that paused for approval was never surfaced, never answered, and therefore
   * never dispatched. The pane showed "Thinking" while the backing service was
   * never called at all. Two implementations of one protocol drift, and only
   * one of them is exercised daily.
   *
   * So preview turns now run on `ChatHttpService` + `StreamParserService` like
   * everything else. That is safe because the whole chat stack is keyed by
   * session id — `getMessagesForSession`, `stateFor`, the parser's per-session
   * state — so the `preview-` session the caller owns is already isolated from
   * the user's real conversations. Isolation was the only thing the fork bought,
   * and it was already there for free.
   *
   * What this does NOT do, and why it is not just `submitChatRequest`:
   *  - No navigation. The preview is embedded in the editor; routing to
   *    `/s/{id}` would throw the user out of the form they are editing.
   *  - No session-cache registration and no conversation-mode binding. A
   *    `preview-` session is never persisted, so it must not appear in the
   *    sidenav or claim the home page's selected mode.
   *  - No `setViewedSession`. The viewed-session facades drive the main
   *    composer; pointing them at a preview id would hijack it.
   *  - A minimal body: an Agent resolves instructions, model, tools, skills and
   *    memory server-side from its own record, so sending the *viewer's* model
   *    and tool selections would fight the bindings and test a shape nobody
   *    will ever run.
