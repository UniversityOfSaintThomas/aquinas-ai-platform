 * load, which fetches the new shell and its new chunk names; this service does
 * that for them when it is safe, and asks them when it is not.
 *
 * - **Failed navigation** → full load of the URL they were going to, unless a
 *   chat response is streaming or a file is uploading (both survive in-app
 *   navigation but not a page load), or the tab already auto-reloaded within
 *   the guard window (the reload did not fix it, so a loop would follow).
 *   Either way it falls back to the refresh prompt.
 * - **Any other chunk failure** (a `@defer` block, a lazily imported library)
 *   → the prompt only. The user did not ask to leave the page they are on.
 * - **Proactive check** → the prompt, when the tab comes back into view and
 *   the served shell names a different `main` bundle from the one running.
 *
 * Composer drafts are safe across any of these loads: the composer mirrors
 * itself to `localStorage` on every change (`ComposerDraftStorageService`),
 * so there is nothing to flush before unloading.
