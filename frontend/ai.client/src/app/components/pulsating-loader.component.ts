/**
 * PulsatingLoaderComponent
 *
 * The line shown while a turn is running: a small pulsing dot, what the agent
 * is doing, and how long it has been doing it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY NO LONGER DOES
 * -------------------------------------
 * It used to cycle twenty invented phrases — "Pondering", "Cross-referencing",
 * "Consulting the archives" — typed out character by character. They were
 * charming and they were fiction: identical whether the model was generating,
 * waiting on a Canvas round trip, or hung. A user watching "Cross-referencing"
 * for ninety seconds learned nothing, and two of those ninety-second turns got
 * abandoned in prod.
 *
 * Everything shown here is now a fact we actually hold:
 *
 * - `status` comes from the runtime's `agent_status` events — the event loop's
 *   own model-call and tool-call boundaries.
 * - `statusTool` is the tool's real name. While a tool runs, its name is the
 *   most accurate label available and invents nothing.
 * - the elapsed timer is measured from the moment the turn was sent.
 *
 * `notice` outranks both. It states a specific fact that is NOT the healthy
 * path (the model is being retried), so it takes the warning colour and the
 * amber dot — the dot matters because it is the part a user tracks
 * peripherally, and changing only the text leaves the indicator looking
 * routine during an outage.

       * The halo is the expanding ring this indicator used to have and lost:
       * it is what made the dot read as something happening rather than
       * something blinking. At 7px with a 13px halo it was subordinate to the
       * text to the point of being easy to miss; at 14px with a 26px halo it
       * outweighed the line beside it. 11px with a 21px halo keeps the same
       * motion, proportions and timing between the two.
       *
       * The element itself paints nothing; it is an 11px positioning box that
       * carries the colour as a colour property, and both layers draw in
       * currentColor. That is what keeps them in sync — the dark and notice
       * variants each set one property instead of three.
       *
       * (No backticks anywhere in this block: the stylesheet lives inside the
       * component's inline template literal, so one would end the template
       * and the build fails on the decorator instead of on the comment.)
       *
       * The two layers are pseudo-elements rather than one animated box
       * because they must scale independently: a halo nested inside a
       * breathing core would multiply the two transforms and wobble.
