/**
 * A managed model's avatar: the uploaded icon, the built-in vendor logo, or a
 * monogram.
 *
 * The three cases are not three fallbacks of decreasing quality — see
 * `resolveModelIcon`. A built-in slug is the *preferred* answer for a vendor we
 * ship a logo for, because it stays a crisp, theme-correct vector at every size,
 * and it costs no storage and no round trip. The upload exists for the models
 * that map to no vendor we ship: an in-house fine-tune, a new provider.
 *
 * Built-in logos come in a light/dark pair, and which one is correct is a CSS
 * question, not a TypeScript one — the pair is rendered with `dark:hidden` /
 * `hidden dark:block` (matching the admin catalog cards) so switching theme never
 * waits on a signal or a re-render.
 *
 * `iconUrl` arrives from the API as a relative path (`/models/{id}/icon?v=…`) so
 * the container never has to know its own public origin; the API base is prefixed
 * here. The `?v=` is the icon's content digest, which is what lets the response be
 * cached `immutable` and still change the instant a new icon is uploaded.
 *
 * A load failure falls through to the monogram rather than leaving a broken tile:
 * the backend answers 404 for a key that outlived its object, and a menu row is a
 * place that has to stay composed.
