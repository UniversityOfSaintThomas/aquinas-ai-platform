# Customize — a browse surface for tools, skills and connectors

**Status:** Step 1 (Customize shell: Tools + Skills) SHIPPED — PR #1072, validated on dev.
Step 3 (drop model + params from the drawer) SHIPPED — PR #1073, validated on dev.
Step 4 (agent-lock surfacing) SHIPPED — PR #1075, validated on dev.
Step 2 (Connectors tab) SHIPPED — PR #1076, validated on dev.
Step 5 (drawer deleted) SHIPPED — PR #1079, validated on dev.
**Epic COMPLETE.** Step 6 declined on evidence; step 7 declined by the owner.
**Supersedes:** the composer settings drawer (`components/model-settings/`) as the home for
tool and skill enablement.
**Related:** `docs/specs/skills-as-agent-primitive.md` (D6 opt-in), `docs/specs/agent-marketplace.md` (D1 one noun),
`docs/specs/per-tool-mcp-enablement.md` equivalent in `tool-search-token-bloat-strategy.md`.

## Problem

Tool and skill enablement is **global, durable, per-user state**:

- `services/skill/skill.service.ts:32` — "preferences persist globally per user"
- `services/tool/tool.service.ts:414` — `savePreferences()` POSTs to the user preferences endpoint

But it is presented in a drawer hanging off the composer, opened by a settings icon
inside the chat input. That container reads as *settings for this conversation*. It is not.
A user who enables a tool to get through one question has changed the `toolConfig` of every
future turn, in every future session, permanently — and nothing in the UI said so.

That is the defect. The secondary problem is capacity: the drawer is a ~320px column with
collapsible sections, and the tool catalog has outgrown it. Per-tool MCP enablement means a
single server (Student MyBoiseState, 17+ tools; canvas_faculty, 44) can exceed the entire
drawer's comfortable length on its own. Browsing is not a thing the drawer can be made to do.

## What Customize is

A full page at `/customize` that owns the things a user *adds to* their assistant:

| Tab | Contents | Today's home |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| **Tools** | The RBAC-granted tool catalog, per-tool and per-server enablement | Drawer § Tools |
| **Skills** | Accessible skills (catalog-granted ∪ authored), opt-in toggles | Drawer § Skills |
| **Connectors** | OAuth connection state for external MCP servers | `Settings → Connectors` (folded in, step 2) |

It is deliberately **capabilities only**. See §"What Customize is not".

## Decision summary

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Does the composer settings drawer survive? | **No.** Deleted in step 5, once its contents have homes |
| Does the settings icon survive? | **No.** `showSettingsControl` default flips to `false`, then the input is removed |
| Where does model selection live? | Composer, where it already is (`chat-input.component.html:274`) |
| Where do inference params live? | **Nowhere user-facing.** Effort subsumes them (step 3) |
| What happens to Conversation Modes? | **Retired as a migration to Agents** (step 6), gated on prod usage |
| Does the Agent Marketplace move into Customize? | **No.** See §"What Customize is not" |
| Does Customize honour the Agent binding lock? | **No — deliberately.** See §"The agent-lock seam" |

## Why the drawer can die entirely

The drawer holds four things. Three of them are already redundant or dead:

**Model selection — redundant.** `<app-model-dropdown />` is already in the composer at
`session/components/chat-input/chat-input.component.html:274`. The drawer's model section is
a second copy of a control the user can already see.

**Advanced params — superseded by effort, already lying, and partly duplicated.** Effort
lives in the model dropdown's submenu with the active level in the trigger
(`components/model-dropdown/model-dropdown.component.ts:41`). Meanwhile GPT-5.6
**hard-rejects** `temperature` and `top_p` (measured; see `docs/specs/gpt-5-6-prompt-caching.md`
and the inference-params findings), so a per-model numeric param form already misrepresents
part of the catalog. Effort is the portable abstraction; the form is not.

**Measured on dev before cutting** (all 9 enabled models, via the live picker + drawer):

| Model | Advanced rows the drawer offered | Effort in the picker |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| GPT-5.6 Sol / Luna | Max Output Tokens, **Reasoning Effort** | yes |
| Claude Sonnet 5, Opus 4.7 | Max Output Tokens, **Effort** | yes |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Temperature, Top P, Max Output Tokens, **Effort** | yes |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | Temperature, Top P, Max Output Tokens | **no** |
| Gemma 4 31B, GPT-5.4 | *(none — section already hidden)* | no |

Two things that changes:

1. **No enabled model exposes Extended Thinking to users.** The `thinking` param is declared
   in `curated-models.ts` for Sonnet 4.6 and Haiku 4.5, but the *deployed* records don't
   enable it, so the row never renders. The feared capability loss does not exist — but note
   the trap: the curated template is not the catalog, and only the live records answer this.
   Re-check before removing anything param-shaped in an environment other than dev.
2. **Effort was rendered twice** — in the picker AND as a row in the drawer's Advanced list.
   So the Advanced section was not merely superseded; for five of nine models its headline
   control was a literal duplicate of one three inches away.

What is left once Effort is deduped is Temperature, Top P and Max Output Tokens — sampling
knobs and a truncation guard.

Removing the form also retires the `max_tokens` ↔ extended-thinking coupling — Anthropic
requires `thinking budget < max_tokens`, which is the entire reason `model-settings.ts`
carried `unsatisfiable`, `clampNotices`, `disabledByConflict` and the post-edit re-check in
`reconcileThinkingAfterMaxTokens`. That machinery and its whole error-state vocabulary go
with it: ~410 lines of component and ~330 of template.

⚠️ `max_tokens` is a **truncation guard**, not a tuning knob. Removing the user control means
the admin default applies — which is already what every untouched user gets (the drawer read
"Defaults" for them). Admin-locked params (`row.locked`, "locked by admin") are unaffected:
this removes the *user-facing form*, not the governance behind it.

⚠️ **Stale overrides are the real hazard, not the missing form.** Overrides live in
`sessionStorage` under `inferenceParamOverrides`, so a tab open across the deploy still holds
whatever the user last typed, and it would keep riding every request with nothing in the UI
to show or reset it. `ModelService.dropRetiredOverrides` strips non-effort keys once, on load,
and rewrites storage. Effort is preserved explicitly — `setEffort` writes through this same
store, so a blanket purge would clear a control the user can still see and is still using.

**Conversation Mode — a strictly weaker Agent.** An admin-authored system prompt attached to
a conversation, with no tools, no skills, no bindings, no icon and no `@`-mention. That is
precisely the relationship Assistants had to Agents, which Marketplace D1 ("there is one noun,
and it is Agent") resolved by migration. Untouched since the PR that introduced it (#411) apart
from the delegated-admin-scope sweep and a theming pass.

Retiring it is bigger than deleting a drawer section — it has admin CRUD pages and routes, an
`admin.system_prompts` delegated scope, an admin nav entry, a user-facing `/system-prompts`
app_api route, a DynamoDB entity, and `system_prompt_id` on the invocation payload
(`apis/inference_api/chat/models.py:188`). ⚠️ **Gate on prod usage before writing any of it.**
"Dormant in git" is not "dormant in prod"; if a department is using a Mode, it has users and
the answer is a migration with redirects, not a deletion.

**Skills and Tools — global state in a conversational container.** The actual problem. They
move to Customize.

Strip the first three and nothing conversation-scoped remains. The drawer is not slimmed; it
is emptied, and then removed.

## What Customize is not

**Not the Agent Marketplace.** Customize is *capabilities you add to your assistant*. An Agent
is not a capability you toggle — it is a thing you talk to. Putting Discover under Customize
while My Agents stays in the sidenav splits one noun across two surfaces, which is the exact
failure D1 exists to prevent and the reason the whole `/assistants` deprecation was written.

The marketplace's real problem is narrower than placement: **Discover is already the first tab
of `/agents`** (`agents/components/agents-tabs.component.ts:22`), but `/agents` resolves to
*My Agents*, which is empty for nearly every user. The emptiest tab is the landing tab. The fix
is a routing change — land `/agents` on Discover when the user has no agents — not a
relocation. It is tracked here as step 7 and is independent of everything else in this spec.

If a future decision does move the marketplace into Customize, it must move **all** of
`/agents` and drop the sidenav entry. Splitting it is the one outcome to avoid.

## The agent-lock seam

⚠️ This is the sharp edge in PR-1, and it is a pre-existing defect the new surface exposes
rather than one it creates.

`ToolService` and `SkillService` are `providedIn: 'root'` singletons. When a conversation is
bound to an Agent, `session.page.ts:806` calls `lockToAgentTools()` / `lockToAgentSkills()`,
which makes `agentLocked()` true, rewrites what `visibleTools()` returns, and causes
`toggleTool()` to **early-return without saving** (`tool.service.ts:272`).

`ngOnDestroy` does **not** release these locks. They are cleared only when the session page
later loads an unbound conversation (`session.page.ts:341,791`). So a user who navigates from
an agent-bound chat straight to `/customize` arrives at a page where:

1. the list shows the Agent's bound set instead of their own preferences, and
2. every toggle silently does nothing.

The lock is conversation-scoped state that leaked into a global singleton. Customize is a
global surface and therefore **must not consult it**:

- Read the user's true state (`tool.isEnabled` / `skill.isEnabled`), never the
  display-shim (`isToolShownEnabled` / `isSkillShownEnabled`).
- Write through a lock-agnostic path. `toggleTool` / `toggleSkill` take an optional
  `{ respectAgentLock }`, defaulting to `true` so drawer behaviour is byte-identical.

Deliberately **not** fixed by clearing locks in `ngOnDestroy`: the `/` ↔ `/s/:id` transition
recreates the session component on a legitimate navigation (`session.page.ts:498`), so a
destroy-time clear would drop and re-apply the lock mid-flow.

The proper resolution is step 4 — the lock is a fact about the *conversation*, so it belongs
on the agent indicator pill
(`session/components/agent-indicator/agent-indicator.component.ts`), which is already
in the conversation and already has an actions menu.

**Step 4's shape.** The indicator takes an `AgentGovernance` input (`modelName`, `toolCount`,
`skillCount`; `null` on a field means "the user's own setting applies"), renders a lock glyph
on the chip, and lists what is fixed in its menu — ending with the line that closes the loop:
*"Your own choices in Customize don't apply in this conversation."*

⚠️ It is derived from the **Agent record** (`chat-container`'s `agent()` input), NOT from
`ToolService.agentLocked()` & friends. Those are the leaking singletons this section is about;
reading them here would reintroduce the same staleness on the surface whose whole job is to
tell the truth about the current conversation. Deriving from the record also makes the preview
surfaces correct for free: the Designer preview and the marketplace test-drive render the
indicator without passing `[agent]`, so they get `null` and say nothing — right, because a
draft being previewed is not a conversation anyone's saved settings apply to.

## Cost consequence

⚠️ **A surface designed to make enabling tools easy will raise enabled-tools-per-user, and
every enabled tool grows `toolConfig` on every turn of every session** — the cacheable prefix
the cost-effectiveness tenet exists to protect. This is the same pressure that made new
injected tools ship `enabledByDefault=False` (default-on was a fleet-wide cache bypass), with
a friendlier face.

Two obligations, in the spec rather than discovered post-ship:

1. **Ordering stays deterministic** regardless of the order the new UI writes preferences in.
   Prompt-cache stability is exact-prefix-match; a set that reorders because the user toggled
   from a grid instead of a list rewrites the whole prefix at the cache-write premium.
2. **Browse should not be cost-blind.** Surfacing per-tool prompt weight (description +
   schema token count) is the honest version of a store that encourages adding things. Not in
   PR-1; named here so it is a decision rather than an omission.

## Sequencing

Each step is independently shippable. 3 and 6 do not depend on Customize at all.

| # | Step | Depends on |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | **Customize shell** — `/customize`, Tools + Skills tabs, nav entry. Drawer stays; both live — **shipped (#1072)** | — |
| 2 | Fold `Settings → Connectors` in as the Connectors tab — **shipped (#1076)** | 1 |
| 3 | Drop model + Advanced params from the drawer (pure dedup + param removal) — **shipped (#1073)** | — |
| 4 | Agent-lock surfacing moves to the assistant indicator — **shipped (#1075)** | — |
| 5 | Delete the drawer and the settings icon — **shipped (#1079)** | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| 6 | Conversation Modes retired as an Agent migration — **DECLINED**, see below | prod-usage check |
| 7 | `/agents` lands on Discover for users with no agents — **DECLINED** by the owner, not pursued | — |

Step 5 is last for a reason: pull the icon before Customize exists and you have removed the
only path to skills and tools. The end-state composer already renders today —
`showSettingsControl` is an existing input, set `false` in the agent preview
(`agents/agent-form/components/agent-preview.component.ts:121`) and the marketplace review
test-drive (`admin/marketplace/components/review-test-drive.component.ts:144`). Step 5 flips
the default and deletes the input.

## Resolved questions

**Does the composer keep a pointer to Customize?** No. The sidenav entry is the path, always
visible and one click away — the same shape Claude uses. Adding a composer affordance would
have reintroduced an icon to replace the one step 5 removes.

**What happens to Conversation Mode?** ⚠️ The spec originally had it retired in step 6 as "a
strictly weaker Agent", on the premise it was dormant. **That premise was wrong.** Prod carries
one enabled mode — *Guided Learning*, a Socratic tutoring prompt — and its use is accelerating:
1 session in July, 20 in August, **60 in the first 12 days of September**. Measured against
`boisestateai-v2-system-prompts` and `sessions-metadata` in the prod account.

So Mode is not dormant, and it is the one genuinely **per-conversation** control the drawer
held. It could not follow Skills and Tools to Customize without recreating the exact scope lie
this epic exists to fix, so it went the other way: into the **composer**, beside the model and
effort controls. Those three are the same question — how should *this* conversation run.

That also reframes step 6: retiring Modes is much harder to justify against growing usage, and
the migration is not clean — a Mode applies to the conversation you are already in, whereas an
Agent is a separate thing you start a chat with. Step 6 is now "reconsider", not "execute".

This is the second time the "git history says dormant" heuristic has misled on this epic (the
first was `thinking` in step 3, declared in `curated-models.ts` and absent from the deployed
records). **Check the data in the environment that matters.**

### ⚠️ The composer picker is PARKED (2026-09-13)

`ConversationModePickerComponent` has been **removed from the composer and deleted from the
tree**, on the owner's call: the placement works, but he wants feedback and thinking time before
committing a permanent composer slot to it. Alternatives under consideration are the conversation
title menu, folding it into the model dropdown, the new-chat empty state, a `/mode` inline command,
and generalising the assistant indicator into a conversation-context chip.

Everything behind the control is untouched and still live: `SystemPromptsService`, the
`/system-prompts/` catalog, `selected_prompt_id` on `SessionPreferences`, the hydration fix in
step 5 notes, and the admin CRUD at `/admin/system-prompts`. **Only the control is gone**, so
restoring it is a revert, not a rebuild.

⚠️ **RELEASE GATE — do not ship this to prod alongside the drawer deletion.** `origin/main` still
carries `components/model-settings/`, so prod users select Guided Learning through the old drawer
today. `develop` deletes that drawer (step 5) *and* now has no picker. The first release that
carries both to prod leaves **no way to select a mode at all**, silently killing a feature at
~60 sessions/month and growing. Before that release: either restore the picker, land a
replacement placement, or accept the regression deliberately and tell derrickfink@boisestate.edu.

## Step 5 notes

⚠️ **A latent bug surfaced while verifying the new picker, and is fixed here.** The session
page hydrates the active mode twice on load: once provisionally, before the session's metadata
arrives, and again with the real value. The provisional call CLAIMED the session id, so the
clobber guard in `hydrateFromSession` rejected the real hydration that followed.

That was not cosmetic. `chat-request.service` sends `selected_prompt_id` from
`activePromptId()`, so **after any reload the mode silently stopped being applied to every
later turn**, while the stored session preference still said it was on. On prod that is every
Guided Learning user who reloaded mid-conversation. The provisional call now passes
`claim: false`; a deliberate "None" still claims, so stale metadata cannot undo it.

It is fixed here rather than deferred because step 5 promotes this control to a first-class
composer affordance, and shipping it more prominently while knowing it silently drops would be
worse than leaving it where it was.

## PR-1 scope

**In:**

- `/customize` → `/customize/tools`, `/customize/skills`, lazy-loaded, `authGuard`
- Tabs strip mirroring `AgentsTabsComponent`
- Browse idiom borrowed from `agents/discover`: search box + category chips + responsive grid
- Cards read the existing root services — no new endpoints, no new state. Because both
  surfaces share the same singletons, a toggle in Customize updates the drawer live and
  vice versa
- Sidenav entry (which also gave `/my-skills` a reachable home — see the standing
  `sidenav.html:92` comment saying its navigation was undecided; step 8 removed
  `/my-skills` entirely, so the entry is now the only path to either half)
- The lock-agnostic write path described in §"The agent-lock seam"

**Out:** connectors tab (step 2), tool detail pane / per-sub-tool expansion, any drawer
deletion, prompt-weight display, marketplace changes.

## Step 2 notes

The page moved wholesale (`git mv`, so history follows it); only the shell changed — tabs
plus an `h1`, and the row/empty/error containers went to `rounded-2xl` so the three tabs read
as one surface. The Connect/Disconnect buttons and the `vendor-*` icon tokens were left
exactly as they were: both carry load-bearing contrast reasoning in their comments.

⚠️ `/settings/connectors` stays as a **redirect**, declared BEFORE the `settings` route whose
`loadChildren` would otherwise swallow it and land the user on the settings shell with no
matching child. A test asserts that ordering, because the failure is silent.

## Tool detail

`/customize/tools/:toolId` — the drill-in the browse grid's cards link to. It carries what
a card cannot: the full description (summary, with the docstring's reference material behind
*Show reference*), an MCP server's tools one by one with their own switches, the prompts and
resources the server exposes, and the catalog facts (protocol, status, granting roles).

⚠️ **Step 5 deleted the drawer, so this is now the only per-sub-tool surface in the app.**
Between #1079 and this page there is nowhere to say "3 of Canvas's 48 tools"; the gap is worth
closing promptly rather than queueing.

It is a **new component, not a port of the drawer's `ToolDetailComponent`**, for the same
reason the list page is not a port of the drawer's list: the drawer was conversation-scoped
(`isToolShownEnabled()`, writes through the Agent lock) and this surface is global
(`tool.isEnabled` / `sub.enabled`, `respectAgentLock: false`). See §"The agent-lock seam".

The drawer's **tab strip did not come with it.** Tabs existed there because the pane was 320px;
on a page, Tools / Prompts / Resources / About are stacked sections, so find-in-page reaches
all of them and nothing hides behind a tab the user has to guess at. The real problem tabs
were solving — a 48-tool server — is solved directly: above eight sub-tools the list grows
its own filter box.

Prompts and resources stay **read-only**, and stay a read of the stored capability snapshot
rather than a live probe, for the reasons the drawer recorded: probing opens an MCP session
per server, a 3LO server cannot be reached without a consent token the browser does not hold,
and acting on an entry needs `prompts/get` / `resources/read`, which this surface has no
endpoint for. The snapshot is only fetched for `mcp_external` tools — nothing else has a
server that could have been asked.

⚠️ The card's name is a link whose `after:absolute inset-0` makes the whole card the
navigation target; the switch is raised out of it with `z-10` rather than nested inside it.
A switch inside the link is a control the user cannot reach by keyboard without also
following the link. A test asserts the switch has no `<a>` ancestor.

⚠️ Colored text uses `text-primary-accessible dark:text-primary-accessible-dark`, never the
numbered ramp. With the brand primary at `#0033a0`, `dark:text-primary-400` measures **2.59:1**
against the dark page background (`gray-900`, `#101828`) — a WCAG AA failure at the small text
sizes involved. The accessible alias is generated to clear 4.5:1 against the resolved dark
surface and measures 4.52:1. See `src/branding/README.md` §7.

**Known gap, not fixed here:** 16% of catalog sub-tools (19 of 116) have docstrings whose first
paragraph runs past 400 characters — `canvas_faculty/import_course_package` reaches 2,058 —
because the prose precedes any `Args:` heading, so `splitToolDescription` returns all of it as
`summary` and the row renders it unclamped. The *detail* behind "Show details" is by comparison
modest (median 344 chars). Clamping the summary is the fix; moving the detail behind a modal
would not touch it.

## Skill detail

`/customize/skills/:skillId` — the sibling drill-in, reached the same way: the card's name is
a link, the switch stays its sibling. It carries the SKILL.md body the skill actually injects,
its supporting files, any composed skills, the advisory `allowed-tools` frontmatter, and the
catalog facts.

⚠️ **Unlike the tool page, this one needed backend work.** `GET /tools/` already returns the
whole `Tool` including `serverTools`, so `/customize/tools/:toolId` is pure frontend.
`GET /skills/` returns six thin fields — id, name, description, category, `userEnabled`,
`isEnabled` — and *everything* worth opening a page for lives on `SkillDefinition` and never
reaches the SPA. The only per-skill read that existed, `GET /skills/mine/{id}`, is
**owner-scoped**: a catalog skill granted to you 404s there.

So this adds **`GET /skills/{id}`**, access-checked by `resolve_accessible_skill_ids` — the
same resolution that builds the picker and that the runtime uses to decide what a turn may
activate — plus **`GET /skills/{id}/resources/{filename}`**, the access-scoped read
counterpart of the owner route, so a granted user can open a catalog skill's reference files.

⚠️ **Route registration order is load-bearing.** Both live at the BOTTOM of
`apis/app_api/skills/routes.py`, below every `/mine` route. Starlette matches in registration
order and `SKILL_ID_PATTERN` happily matches the literal string `mine` — declare `/{skill_id}`
first and `GET /skills/mine` becomes a lookup for a skill called "mine", which 404s for every
user in the product. A test asserts it.

`GET /skills/` was **not** fattened instead. It is a first-load payload covering every granted
skill; a SKILL.md body per row would be paid on every load to render a list that shows neither
the body nor the files.

**What the detail response deliberately omits.** `ownerId` — `isOwned` is the only part of
ownership this surface needs, and a raw owner id would name one user to another. And
`allowedAppRoles`, which is an admin-display projection of RBAC (see the RBAC §in CLAUDE.md)
and has no business on a page any granted user can open. A skill the caller cannot reach 404s
rather than 403s, so the endpoint never confirms the existence of a skill someone else holds;
a non-ACTIVE catalog skill 404s too, matching the ACTIVE filter `GET /skills/` already applies
— though an owner still reads their own draft, because ownership is its own grant.

**Instructions render expanded**, not behind a disclosure like the tool page's `Args:` block.
They are not a secret from a user the skill is granted to: this is the text their own turns
load on dispatch, so the honest answer to "what does this skill do" is to show it. Rendered
through `ngx-markdown` **with sanitization on** — do not add `[disableSanitizer]`; a SKILL.md
body can be authored by a non-admin (Skills v2 PR-3 user tier), and the reasoning recorded on
`announcement-modal.component.ts` applies unchanged.

**`allowedTools` is rendered with its advisory status stated in the copy**, not as a bare list.
Skills v2 D4: the platform never grants, mounts or folds a tool because a skill names it. A
bare list of tool names on a page about a skill you just enabled would read as a grant.

**A skill the user authored links to `/customize/skills/{id}/edit`** rather than growing a
second editor here. One destination for every card; the read view stays useful for your own
skill. (This link read `/my-skills/{id}/edit` until step 8 folded that route in.)

**This page closes no functional gap**, and that is the difference from the tool detail page.
That one had to exist the moment #1079 deleted the drawer, because per-sub-tool enablement had
nowhere else to live. A skill has no sub-unit — the only control here is the same on/off the
card already offers — so this page is informational, and was queued rather than rushed.

⚠️ The switch stays **disabled until the picker list lands**. `SkillService.toggleSkill`
silently returns on a skill it has never loaded, so on a deep link a click before the list
arrived would look like a broken switch rather than a dead moment. The page warms
`loadSkills()` in its constructor and gates the control on `initialized()`.

**Cost:** none against the model. Everything here is catalog data read for display; nothing
reaches the system prompt or `toolConfig`, so the cacheable prefix is untouched. The added
traffic is one `GET /skills/{id}` per drill-in, cached for the life of the page.

The `settings/connectors/` **services** deliberately did not move. `UserConnectorsService` and
`ConnectorStatusService` have nine importers across the app (oauth-consent, export-dialog,
knowledge-base, the drawer's tool-detail, the Customize Tools tab…), so relocating them is a
wide, purely-mechanical diff that belongs on its own. Their real home is probably
`services/connectors/` — noted, not done here.


## Outcome

Five of seven steps shipped; two were declined on their merits rather than dropped.

| # | Step | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Customize shell (Tools + Skills) | #1072 |
| 2 | Connectors folded in | #1076 |
| 3 | Model + params out of the drawer | #1073 |
| 4 | Agent governance on the indicator | #1075 |
| 5 | Mode to the composer, drawer deleted | #1079 |
| 6 | Retire Conversation Modes | **Declined** |
| 7 | `/agents` lands on Discover | **Declined** |

The end state:

- **Composer** — per-conversation: model, effort, conversation mode.
- **Customize** — global: tools, skills, connectors.
- **Assistant indicator** — says which of those an Agent has fixed, and that Customize
  choices do not apply here.

The original defect is closed: nothing global is presented as conversational any more.

### Step 6 — declined

The premise ("a Conversation Mode is a strictly weaker Agent, and they're dormant") did not
survive contact with the data. Prod carries one enabled mode, *Guided Learning*, used in 81
sessions and accelerating — 1 in July, 20 in August, 60 in the first 12 days of September. And
the migration was never clean: a Mode applies to the conversation you are **already in**,
whereas an Agent is a separate thing you start a chat with. Converting one into the other is a
product change for its users, not a refactor.

Modes now have a better home than the one the retirement was meant to escape, so the
motivation is gone too.

### What this epic should be remembered for

**Check the data in the environment that matters.** The plan was wrong twice, in opposite
directions, and both times the code was the misleading source:

- Step 3: `curated-models.ts` declared `thinking` for two models; the deployed records did not
  enable it. Reading the file would have blocked a safe removal.
- Step 6: git history said Conversation Modes were untouched since #411; prod said usage was
  compounding. Reading the history would have deleted a live feature.

**Verify in a browser before merging.** Every step but one had a defect that only the browser
found — `1 tools`, a menu wrapping "Claude Sonnet 5" across three lines, and a mode that
silently stopped applying after a reload. None were caught by 2800 passing tests.

## Step 8 — one skills surface

`/my-skills` is gone. It was a top-level route reachable only by a link-out from
`/customize/skills`, which meant the same noun lived in two places with two different answers
to "what skills do I have?" — one page listed what you *authored*, the other what you could
*turn on*, and neither showed the whole set. Both now live under `/customize/skills`, split by
a `scope` query param rather than by route:

| Scope | Population | Idiom |
|---|---|---|
| **Yours** (default) | skills you authored, at any status, **plus** catalog skills you have turned on | dense rows, with edit/delete on the ones you own |

Turning a skill on is this platform's analogue of "installing" one. There is no install step:
access is RBAC (`resolve_accessible_skill_ids`) and the only state a user owns is the
enablement preference. That is what makes the two-scope split meaningful here rather than an
imported metaphor.

**No backend change.** The page reads two endpoints that already existed and merges them
client-side:

- `GET /skills/` (`SkillService`) — the picker feed: accessible **and ACTIVE**, with the
  enablement preference.
- `GET /skills/mine` (`MySkillService`) — the authored tier, at **every** status.

⚠️ The merge is what keeps a DRAFT skill visible to its author. A non-active skill is filtered
out of `GET /skills/` by status, and widening that endpoint to carry drafts was considered and
rejected: it feeds the composer picker, so a draft would appear as activatable in chat while
the runtime's `_apply_enabled_skills_filter` refuses it. Two reads on one page is the cheaper
mistake.

⚠️ A draft therefore has **no toggle at all** (`toggleable` on `SkillRowComponent`), not a
disabled one. `SkillService.toggleSkill` returns silently for a skill it never loaded, so the
button would have been a control that does nothing.

**Routing.** `/customize/skills/new` and `/customize/skills/{id}/edit` now host the authoring
form (`git mv`, so history follows it). The three old paths stay as **redirects** — they are in
bookmarks, and the detail page linked to `/my-skills/{id}/edit` for its whole life.

⚠️ `customize/skills/new` MUST stay declared **above** `customize/skills/:skillId`. The router
matches in declaration order, so the parameterised route would otherwise swallow it and the
create form would render "skill not found" for a skill named `new`. Same class of trap as the
`/settings/connectors` ordering in step 2, and as `/{skill_id}` vs `/mine` on the backend
router.

⚠️ `setScope` calls `router.navigate([], { relativeTo: this.route, ... })`. **`relativeTo` is
load-bearing** — without it the empty command list resolves against the root, the navigation
lands on the same URL with the query params dropped, and the scope silently never changes.
The browser found this; the tests did not, because they drive the `scope` input directly (the
test router has no matched route to bind a query param back through).

**Add ▾** replaces the old "New skill" button and the link-out, offering *Upload skill*
(`?import=1`, which re-titles the form and leads with the SKILL.md import block) and *Create a
skill*. It is gated on `accessible$() === true` — the same 404-from-`/skills/mine` signal that
used to hide the whole `/my-skills` page, because with `SKILLS_ENABLED` off the form could only
fail to save. The picker is **not** auto-clicked on `?import=1`: a programmatic `.click()` on a
file input without a user gesture is blocked or suppressed in several browsers, and a menu item
that silently does nothing is worse than one extra click.

## Known gaps

- **The assistant indicator does not render until a conversation has messages**
  (`showChatTopnav` requires `!isEmptyState()`). So the first turn of a new agent-bound
  conversation happens with no governance cue on screen. Raised during step 4, deliberately
  not fixed: it predates this epic and the launch card already names the agent.
- **`settings/connectors/` services** live under a feature folder with no page. Nine importers;
  their real home is `services/connectors/`. Mechanical, deferred (step 2 notes).
