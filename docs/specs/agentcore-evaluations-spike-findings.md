# AgentCore Evaluations — spike findings

**Date:** August 12, 2026 · **Status:** spike complete, recommendation below
**Question:** before we write the quality-veto eval harness by hand, does the
`bedrock_agentcore.evaluation` package in our existing pin do the job?

**Verdict: adopt it for judging and trajectory scoring; build our own arm
runner and experimental design. It removes roughly a third of the build and
cannot satisfy one requirement at all (blinding) — which is worth knowing
before someone designs around it.**

*Context:* the harness is the shared asset described by
`compaction-over-threshold-cache-spiral.md` §4.3, `compaction-v2-versioned-prefix.md`
§8, and `document-offload-evaluation.md` §2. All three predate the
`bedrock-agentcore` 1.21.0 bump (#857, merged 2026-08-11) and none mentions
this package. It has in fact been in the SDK since at least 1.9.1.

## 1. What was verified, and how

Everything below was run against **dev-ai** (`us-west-2`), not read from docs.

| claim | evidence |
|---|---|
| The APIs exist on our pinned boto3 | boto3/botocore **1.43.68** expose `Evaluate`, `StartBatchEvaluation`, and the full evaluator CRUD on `bedrock-agentcore` / `bedrock-agentcore-control` |
| The service is authorized for us — not preview-gated | `list_evaluators()` returns **16 built-in evaluators**, all `ACTIVE` |
| The whole pipeline works end-to-end **today, unmodified** | Ran `EvaluationClient.run()` against a real dev conversation: 272 spans collected, 4 scored results returned, explanations quoting the actual conversation text |
| Session correlation is already deterministic | `runtime_session_id_for()` (`apis/shared/harness/runner.py:63`) is `sid-<sha256(session_id)>` — every conversation the existing headless harness drives maps to its spans with no new plumbing |

### The built-in evaluators

- **TRACE, response quality (8):** Correctness, Faithfulness, Helpfulness,
  ResponseRelevance, Conciseness, Coherence, InstructionFollowing, Refusal
- **TRACE, safety (2):** Harmfulness, Stereotyping
- **SESSION (4):** GoalSuccessRate, TrajectoryExactOrderMatch,
  TrajectoryInOrderMatch, TrajectoryAnyOrderMatch
- **TOOL_CALL (2):** ToolSelectionAccuracy, ToolParameterAccuracy

Custom evaluators come in two shapes, per the `CreateEvaluator` input model:
`llmAsAJudge` (instructions + rating scale + model config — fully managed, no
infra) and `codeBased` (a Lambda ARN, wrapped by the SDK's
`@custom_code_based_evaluator()` decorator).

### Where the conversation content actually lives — read this before extending anything

This is the part a documentation-only read gets wrong, and it nearly derailed
this spike.

`aws/spans` in dev-ai holds 117 MB of spans, and **not one of them carries
message content.** The `strands.telemetry.tracer` spans there have token counts
and model ids and nothing else; a query for any span with a non-empty `events`
array across seven days returns **zero rows**. Read only that, and the obvious
conclusion is "content capture is off, this needs observability work first."

That conclusion is wrong. Content arrives as **OTLP log records**, not span
events — emitted by `strands.telemetry.tracer` into the *runtime* log group with
`eventName = "strands.telemetry.tracer"` and a `body` of:

```
{"input":  {"messages": [{"role": "system"|"user"|"tool", "content": …}, …]},
 "output": {"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": …}]}}
```

They carry `traceId` / `spanId` / `scope`, so they duck-type past the
collector's `_is_valid_adot_document` check and get swept up alongside real
spans. In the session sampled: 21 content-bearing log records among 359
documents. `CloudWatchAgentSpanCollector` queries **both** `aws/spans` and the
runtime log group and unions them, which is why the end-to-end call works —
the content comes entirely from the second query.

Two consequences worth writing down:

1. **Don't "fix" content capture.** It isn't broken. Setting
   `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` tokens to chase span events would change the
   emission shape out from under a path that already works.
   *Superseded 2026-09-25:* the inference-api image now sets
   `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=gen_ai_unredacted_attributes=`, so these log
   records carry `[REDACTED]` instead of messages. The shape is unchanged, so
   the collector still finds them, but the judge has nothing to read. An
   environment that turns on eval sampling must override the variable on the
   Runtime (see `feedback_eval_sampling_enabled`).
2. The runtime log group name is the AWS-suffixed one
   (`…_agentcore_runtime-Z6D3HsHKs6-DEFAULT`), not the prefix-derived name.
   Querying the wrong one returns zero rows rather than an error — the same
   trap that hid the broken dashboard widgets fixed in #843.

### What a real result looks like

`Builtin.Correctness` on a live dev conversation returned `value: 1.0`, label
`"Perfectly Correct"`, `tokenUsage` of 1,728 tokens, and a paragraph of
explanation that correctly identified that the agent's tool calls had 502'd,
that it declined to fabricate results, and that it had accurately reported the
failure. That is a usable judge, not a rubber stamp.

## 2. What it does not give us

The harness specs ask for a specific experimental design. The SDK gives a
runner, not that design.

- **Paired A/B arms.** `OnDemandEvaluationDatasetRunner` executes one dataset
  against one invoker. Arms, k=3 replicates at production temperature,
  order-swapped pairwise judging, per-family reporting, McNemar — all ours.
- **Blinding — and this one is structural, not a gap.** The offload eval
  (§2.4) requires stripping transcripts to *final answer text only* before
  judging, because arm C transcripts contain `document_read` calls and
  `<document-digest>` blocks that give the arm away. AgentCore Evaluations
  works by feeding the evaluator the whole span set — content-in-spans **is**
  the mechanism. There is no scrubbing seam. **The blinded pairwise holistic
  judge therefore cannot run through this service**; it needs our own judge
  over scrubbed text. Everything else can.
- **Programmatic ground-truth scoring.** `ReferenceInputs` carries
  `assertions` / `expected_response` / `expected_trajectory`, but exact-match
  scoring against planted facts, table cells, and remapped page numbers is a
  local function. Routing it through a Lambda-backed `codeBased` evaluator is
  infrastructure weight for something a pure function does better.
- **Cost and token metrics.** We already read these from the `C#` rows, and
  `partial_miss` (#838) is a better instrument than anything in the spans.
- **The corpus.** Planted-fact document generation, the BSU public scrape, the
  chart-only pages that make the dual-encoding question answerable — all ours,
  and that was always where the actual thinking lived.

### Operational notes

- The on-demand runner sleeps `evaluation_delay_seconds` (**default 180s**) for
  span ingestion, then the collector polls on top of that. Batch the arms;
  don't put this in a tight loop.
- Each `evaluate` call is billed LLM usage (~1.7k tokens for one TRACE-level
  Correctness call). At 120 tasks × 3 replicates × 2 arms this is real but
  modest — budget it, and prefer the free trajectory matchers where they answer
  the question.
- Evaluator level drives batching: SESSION sends one request, TRACE fans out
  over trace ids, TOOL_CALL over tool span ids, capped at 10 targets per
  request.

### One scoping decision to make deliberately

The `body` payload carries the **full system prompt and every user message**
into an AWS-managed evaluator. For the synthetic corpus the harness is designed
around, that is a non-issue — the corpus is ours and contains no user content.
It becomes a real decision only if someone later points this at recorded
production conversations. Decide it then, explicitly; don't let it happen as a
side effect of reusing the same script.

## 3. Recommendation

**Hybrid.** Concretely:

**Use AgentCore Evaluations for**
- the tool-trajectory families — `TrajectoryInOrderMatch` and
  `ToolSelectionAccuracy` directly answer "did the model call `document_read`
  when it needed to, with the right arguments", which is the
  `document_read` health band the offload eval (§3.1) already wants
- `GoalSuccessRate` and `InstructionFollowing` for the long-session
  constraint-retention families in #833 §4.3
- a **secondary, non-blinded** quality signal — useful as the second judge the
  eval design calls for on a 20% sample

**Build ourselves**
- the arm runner, extending `experiment_agent_cache_arms.py` (already drives
  real multi-turn dev-ai sessions through the runtime gateway; don't rebuild
  it — and salt priming text per arm, per the G1 confound)
- the corpus and planted-fact generation
- programmatic lookup / citation / page-identity scoring
- the **blinded** pairwise holistic judge plus the scrubber, which the managed
  path cannot do
- the statistics and the stopping rule

**Net effect:** this removes roughly a third of the build — the judging
infrastructure, tool-trajectory scoring, and result plumbing — and leaves the
experimental design, which is the part that was always going to need care. It
also converts one open spec question ("who writes the judges?") into a
configuration choice.

**What it does not change:** the harness is still a prerequisite for #833 PR-2,
#833 PR-4, #835 v2, and #836 PRs 1–4, and it still needs an owner. It is now a
smaller job than the specs assumed.

## 4. Follow-ups this spike opens

1. **The three eval spec sections should be amended** to name the hybrid split
   — otherwise the next reader re-derives it, or worse, designs the blinded
   judge on top of a service that cannot blind.
2. **`Builtin.Faithfulness` is worth a second look for the offload work
   specifically.** It scores whether a response is supported by provided
   context — which is close to the exact question "did the digest lose
   something the document had". Not in any spec today; may be a better primary
   than a hand-rolled rubric for the holistic family.
3. **Online evaluation configs** (`CreateOnlineEvaluationConfig`) went
   unexamined here. If they sample live traffic continuously, that is a
   candidate for the "standing verification in prod" the spiral spec asks for
   in §4.4 — but it points a managed evaluator at real user conversations, so
   read §2's scoping note first.
