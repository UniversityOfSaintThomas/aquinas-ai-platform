# Retiring an MCP server

**Status:** Runbook, and every stage works with today's code. §7 shipped, which
is what gives `status` its first readers — before it, Stage 1 was cosmetic.
**Scope:** A `TOOL#<id>` catalog row with `protocol: mcp_external` or `mcp`
(AgentCore Gateway), that one or more Agents already bind. Retiring a *built-in*
tool differs in one place only — §9.
**Refs:** `agent_binding_resolver._resolve_tools` is the fact the whole plan is
shaped around (§1); `docs/specs/admin-always-on-tools.md` §2.3 for the pin that
has to come off first; `docs/specs/agent-version-snapshots.md` for why a
published Agent cannot be fixed by its author alone (§5d).

---

## The question this answers

> Should retirement start by making the server not viewable / not bindable for
> new work, while keeping it functional for legacy Agents that already bind it?

**Yes — and it is the only safe first move.** But "not bindable" has to mean
*the picker will not offer it for a new selection*. It must **not** mean
"remove the grant" or "delete the row", because both of those are the last
step, not the first, and each fails in a different ugly way (§1).

The good news is that no new grant-layer primitive is needed. `ToolStatus`
already had the word (`DEPRECATED`); what was missing was a *reader* on the
pickers. §7 is that reader — one backend field plus a guard on each surface that
can newly adopt a tool — and it involves **no divergence between listing and
enforcement**, which matters because this repo has a standing rule against
exactly that (§4).

---

## 1. The thing that decides the design

Revoking access to a bound tool **blocks** an Agent. It does not degrade it.

`_resolve_tools`
([`agent_binding_resolver.py:255`](../../backend/src/apis/inference_api/chat/agent_binding_resolver.py#L255))
re-checks every bound tool against the **invoking** user and raises
`AgentBindingBlockedError` on the first miss. The route turns that into a
conversational `stream_error` and the turn is over:

> This agent uses the tool **canvas_faculty**, which isn't available to your
> account. Ask an administrator for access, or use a different agent.

That is D5 "block-with-message, no silent drop", and it is correct behaviour —
an Agent composed of seven tools that quietly runs with six is a worse outcome
than a clear refusal. It just means revocation is a **loud, total** operation on
the bindings axis, while it is a silent narrowing everywhere else:

| Surface | Predicate | What happens when the tool becomes inaccessible |
|---|---|---|
| Plain-chat picker (`enabled_tools`) | `filter_requested_tools` ([`rbac/service.py:321`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/rbac/service.py#L321)) | silently narrowed out |
| Admin always-on pin | `resolve_always_on_tool_ids` → `filter_requested_tools` | silently not pinned |
| Scheduled run (`enabledTools` snapshot) | `filter_requested_tools` | silently narrowed out |
| Spreadsheet auto-enable | `can_access_tool` per id | silently skipped |
| **Agent `tool` binding** | `can_access_tool` in `_resolve_tools` | **whole turn blocked, with a message** |

So there are three levers, and they fail in three different ways:

| Lever | Effect on a bound Agent | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Revoke the grant (drop from `grantedTools`, clear `isPublic`) | Hard block, every turn, every invoker | **Last loud step.** Stage 3 |
| Hard-delete the `TOOL#` row, leave grants | `can_access_tool` still passes (the grant set is built from role records, not from the catalog), so `_resolve_tools` admits it — then `external_mcp_client` hits `if not tool: continue` ([`external_mcp_client.py:544`](../../backend/src/agents/main_agent/integrations/external_mcp_client.py#L544)) and the server is silently absent. The Agent runs, answers confidently, and has none of its tools | **The worst outcome, and it is what "just delete it" produces.** Never reach this state |
| Leave both, stop offering it in the pickers | Nothing changes for anyone who already has it | **First step.** Stage 1 |

The middle row is the reason the ordering in §6 is not negotiable: grants come
off *before* the row, never after.

---

## 2. `ToolStatus`: vocabulary that had no readers

`ToolStatus` (ACTIVE / DEPRECATED / DISABLED / COMING_SOON,
[`tools/models.py:124`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/tools/models.py#L124)) is
settable by an admin — the tool form has the dropdown
([`tool-form.page.ts:920`](../../frontend/ai.client/src/app/admin/tools/pages/tool-form.page.ts#L920)).
Verified empirically, here is every place it is read:

| Reader | Filters on status? |
|---|---|
| `repository.list_tools(status=…)` | Yes — but only when a caller passes one |
| `ToolCatalogService.get_all_tools(status=…)` → `GET /admin/tools/?status=` | Yes. **The only caller that passes a status.** Admin list page only |
| `ToolCatalogService._get_all_active_tools()` from `get_user_accessible_tools` ([`tools/service.py:87`](../../backend/src/apis/app_api/tools/service.py#L87)) | **No.** Passes `status=None`. The name is a lie |
| `freshness._get_snapshot` → `get_public_tool_ids` / `get_all_tool_ids` / `get_always_on_tool_ids` | **No — deliberately.** The docstring says so: enforcement and the picker must agree about which tools `isPublic` reaches |
| `AppRoleService` (every gate) | **No.** Never reads the catalog row at all, only role records ∪ the public set |
| `agents/` runtime — `base_agent`, `external_mcp_client`, `tool_filter`, `gateway_integration` | **No.** Grep for `.status` under `backend/src/agents/` returns HTTP status codes and one document-rehydration check. Nothing tool-catalog |
| `BindableItem.meta` for `kind=tool` ([`bindable_catalog.py:111`](../../backend/src/apis/app_api/agent_designer/services/bindable_catalog.py#L111)) | **Does not carry `status` at all.** The Agent Designer picker is structurally blind to it |
| SPA `reconcileToolRefs` ([`tool-ref-reconcile.ts`](../../frontend/ai.client/src/app/agents/agent-form/tool-ref-reconcile.ts)) | Yes — the one real consumer. Flags a non-`active` ref on *template prefill*, and still applies it |

Two consequences worth stating before anyone's first move:

1. **`status` gated nothing before §7**, which is the state the table above
   describes. It still gates nothing on the *access* or *runtime* paths and
   never will — §4 is emphatic about that — but as of §7 the pickers read it.
2. So `DELETE /api/admin/tools/{id}` without `hard=true` (`soft_delete_tool`,
   which sets `status: DISABLED`) is no longer a no-op: it now performs Stage 1's
   third step as a side effect. It still does **not** revoke anything, so it is
   safe — but it is not the "remove the tool" an admin reaching for Delete
   probably means, and it is not reversible through the Delete button. Flip
   `status` back to `active` on the tool form to undo it.
3. The word we needed already existed. `DEPRECATED` needed readers, not a new
   enum value, and §7 adds them.

---

## 3. `isPublic` is a real grant — rank it with revocation, not with hiding

`_tool_grant_set` ([`rbac/service.py:251`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/rbac/service.py#L251))
unions `get_public_tool_ids()` into the caller's role grant, and every tool gate
goes through it. `test_public_tool_grants.py` is the regression cover for the
era when it did not.

So for a public MCP server, **clearing `isPublic` is a revocation of every
user's grant at once** and therefore a hard block for every Agent binding it.
It belongs in Stage 3 alongside `grantedTools` edits — never in Stage 1 as a
"just make it less visible" move. (It *also* hides it from the picker, which is
what makes it tempting.)

---

## 4. Which predicates would have to diverge, and whether that is safe

Name them precisely.

**The listing predicate** is `ToolCatalogService.get_user_accessible_tools(user)`
→ `_get_all_active_tools()` (all rows, no status filter) + `_compute_granted_by`
(`is_public` ∨ `"*"` ∨ `tool_id in permissions.tools`). One function, **three**
consumers:

- `GET /tools/` — the plain-chat tool picker
- `bindable_catalog._list_tools` — the Agent Designer palette
- `binding_validation._validate_tool` — the design-time **write** check
  ([`binding_validation.py:224`](../../backend/src/apis/app_api/agent_designer/services/binding_validation.py#L224))

**The enforcement predicate** is `AppRoleService.can_access_tool` →
`_tool_grant_set` (role grant ∪ public set).

The standing rule — stated in the `rbac/service.py` module docstring, in
`freshness.get_public_tool_ids`, and enforced by `test_public_tool_grants.py` —
forbids these two disagreeing. Read its rationale, though: the bug it exists to
close is **list-then-deny**, a tool the picker offers and the gate then refuses.
Retirement wants the opposite arrow: **hide-then-still-allow**.

Those two directions are not symmetric and should not be governed by one rule.
List-then-deny shows a user an affordance that fails. Hide-then-allow hides an
affordance that would have worked. Only the first is a bug; the second is the
definition of grandfathering. **A deliberate hide-then-allow divergence is
safe** — with one qualification, which is the whole reason §7 does not do it at
the grant layer:

> **You cannot get it by status-filtering `get_user_accessible_tools`,** because
> `_validate_tool` reads that same function. Filter it, and an author who opens
> an Agent binding the retiring server and changes one word of its instructions
> gets `403 You do not have access to tool 'canvas_faculty'` — for a tool their
> Agent can still run. They are not *stranded* (validation only inspects the
> bindings actually submitted, so removing the binding always saves), but they
> are lied to at exactly the moment we are asking them to cooperate.

Two routes were considered and one declined:

| Route | What it needs | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Grant-layer.** A `RETIRING` status that `get_user_accessible_tools` filters out while `can_access_tool` still admits | Splitting `_validate_tool` off the palette source and giving it the record's **prior** bindings so a grandfathered ref validates while a newly-added one does not. That prior-bindings argument is a genuinely new primitive — `validate_agent_write` is currently stateless with respect to the stored record | **Declined.** Larger change, and it makes the palette and the write validator disagree, which is a second divergence with no story behind it |
| **Display-layer.** Carry `status` on `BindableItem.meta`, and have the pickers refuse to *add* a non-`active` ref while leaving an already-selected one alone | One field on a free-form dict, two SPA guards | **Adopted (§7).** Listing, write-validation and enforcement keep reading one grant set. The only thing that changes is what a picker offers for a **new** selection |

The display-layer route is not a security boundary — a crafted `PUT /agents/{id}`
can still add the binding. That is fine: the threat model here is *accidental
new adoption*, not a determined author. The security boundary stays where it
is, in `can_access_tool`, and it moves only in Stage 3.

---

## 5. Enumerating the blast radius

Five populations. Do all five before touching anything — Stage 0 exists so that
the count of affected Agents is a number in a ticket, not a surprise in Stage 3.

### a. Roles that grant it

```bash
curl -s "$APP_API/api/admin/tools/$TOOL_ID/roles" | jq '.roles[].roleId'
```

Backed by GSI2 `ToolRoleMappingIndex` (`GSI2PK = TOOL#<id>`).

> ⚠️ **Blind to the wildcard.** A role whose `grantedTools` contains `*` writes
> `GSI2PK = "TOOL#*"` ([`seed_bootstrap_data.py:690`](../../backend/scripts/seed_bootstrap_data.py#L690))
> and never appears under `TOOL#<id>`. A "0 roles" answer does **not** mean
> nobody is granted. List wildcard holders separately:
>
> ```bash
> curl -s "$APP_API/api/admin/roles" | jq -r '.roles[] | select(.grantedTools | index("*")) | .roleId'
> ```

### b. `isPublic`

```bash
curl -s "$APP_API/api/admin/tools/$TOOL_ID" | jq '{isPublic, status, alwaysOn, protocol}'
```

`isPublic: true` ⇒ every authenticated user is granted, and (a) told you almost
nothing.

### c. Agents that bind it — bare **and** scoped

There is no reverse index from tool to Agent. Scan the assistants table. One
scan covers both populations, because a version snapshot shares the Agent's
partition key (`PK = AST#<id>`, `SK = VERSION#00000003`) with the live record
(`SK = METADATA`):

```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name "$ASSISTANTS_TABLE" \
  --projection-expression "PK,SK,ownerId,#n,visibility,listing,bindings" \
  --expression-attribute-names '{"#n":"name"}' \
  --output json \
| jq --arg t "$TOOL_ID" '
    .Items[]
    | select([.bindings.L[]?.M
              | select(.kind.S == "tool")
              | .ref.S
              | select(. == $t or startswith($t + "::"))] | length > 0)
    | {pk: .PK.S, sk: .SK.S, name: .name.S, owner: .ownerId.S,
       visibility: .visibility.S,
       listingState: .listing.M.state.S,
       publishedVersion: .listing.M.publishedVersion.N,
       refs: [.bindings.L[].M | select(.kind.S=="tool") | .ref.S]}'
```

The `startswith($t + "::")` clause is not optional. A scoped ref
(`canvas_faculty::list_assignments`,
[`scoped_ids.py`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/tools/scoped_ids.py)) binds a
subset of the same server, blocks on the same `can_access_tool` call (which is
keyed on the base id), and is invisible to an equality match.

### d. Which of those are published — and therefore not fixable by their author

`resolve_invocation_agent`
([`version_resolution.py:80`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/assistants/version_resolution.py#L80)):

| Invoker | Runs |
|---|---|
| Owner | their live draft |
| Anyone else, `listing.publishedVersion` set | **the frozen `AgentVersion` snapshot** |
| Anyone else, nothing published | the live record |

`AgentVersion` freezes `bindings`
([`assistants/models.py:239`](../../backend/src/apis/shared/assistants/models.py#L239)).
So for a published Agent, **the author removing the binding from their draft
fixes it for themselves and for nobody else.** The snapshot keeps the retired
ref until a new version is submitted *and* approved.

This is the single most expensive thing to discover late. Two admin escape
hatches exist — see Stage 2.

### e. Everything else holding the id

| Holder | Where | Severity if left |
|---|---|---|
| `alwaysOn` pin (bare or `base::name`) | the catalog row's own `alwaysOn`, or an `mcpConfig.tools[].alwaysOn` entry | **Must come off in Stage 1.** A pin is unioned into every granted user's turn; leaving it means the retiring server is being *pushed* while you are trying to withdraw it |
| Admin agent templates | `agent_templates` rows, `bindings[]` | **Must come off in Stage 1.** A template mints a fresh binding every time someone clicks "Start from a template" |
| Scheduled prompts | `enabledTools` snapshot | Low — silently narrowed at run time |
| `UserToolPreference` rows | `toolPreferences` map keys | None. Inert leftovers |
| Sessions | `enabledTools` on session rows | None |

---

## 6. The staged sequence

Two lines run through this, and they are in different places. Say both out
loud in the ticket:

- **The blast line is Stage 3.** It is the first stage a user can experience as
  a failure.
- **The point of no return is Stage 4.** It is the first stage whose *state*
  cannot be restored. Stage 3 is reversible in about a minute (§ Stage 3
  rollback); what is not reversible about it is the errors already shown.

### Stage 0 — Inventory (no user-visible change)

Run all of §5. Record in the retirement ticket: granting roles (including
wildcard holders), `isPublic`, the full Agent list split into *live-record* and
*published-snapshot* populations, owners' emails, the `alwaysOn` state, and any
template refs.

Export the row itself now, not at Stage 4 — an `mcp_external` row's
`mcpConfig` (endpoint URL, transport, auth type, `tokenExchangeAudience`,
`forwardAuthToken`, and the curated `tools[]` list with its per-tool
`needsApproval` / `alwaysOn` flags) was hand-entered by an admin and exists
nowhere else:

```bash
curl -s "$APP_API/api/admin/tools/$TOOL_ID" > retirement-$TOOL_ID-metadata.json
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name "$APP_ROLES_TABLE" \
  --key "{\"PK\":{\"S\":\"TOOL#$TOOL_ID\"},\"SK\":{\"S\":\"CAPABILITIES\"}}" \
  > retirement-$TOOL_ID-capabilities.json
```

**Rollback:** n/a.

### Stage 1 — Stop new adoption. Existing bindings untouched

Three changes, none of which touches a grant or the row's existence:

1. **Unpin.** Clear `alwaysOn` on the row and on every `mcpConfig.tools[]`
   entry. `PUT /api/admin/tools/{id}`, or the admin tool form.
2. **De-template.** Remove every `{"kind":"tool","ref":"<id>…"}` binding from
   admin agent templates.
3. **Set `status: deprecated`** on the row. §7 is what makes this bite: every
   surface that can newly adopt a tool starts refusing it, while every surface
   that already has it is untouched.

What does **not** change: `grantedTools`, `isPublic`, the row, the Gateway
target. `can_access_tool` returns exactly what it returned yesterday, so
**every Agent that binds this server keeps working, for every invoker,
including from a frozen snapshot.** Plain-chat users who have it toggled on keep
it (§7 gates *new* selection, not an existing one).

**Tell the Agent owners now**, not at Stage 3 — this is the whole point of the
stage. Template in §8.

**Rollback:** set `status` back to `active`; re-pin; restore the template
bindings. Fully reversible, seconds, no user-visible trace.

**Cost note.** Any admin write to the row bumps its `updated_at`, which moves
`freshness.get_freshness_hash` and therefore the agent-cache key, so the next
turn of every live session touching this server rebuilds its `Agent` and pays
one Bedrock cache write. Unavoidable and one-off — but it means Stages 1 and 3
should each be a *single* edit, not a morning of fiddling with the tool form.
Stage 3 additionally changes `permissions.tools`, which reaches `toolConfig`, so
affected users pay a second one-off prefix re-write there.

### Stage 2 — Drive the binding count to zero

Chase the list from §5c. For each Agent:

- **Live-record Agents** (no `publishedVersion`): the owner edits the Agent and
  removes the binding. This always saves, even after the owner has lost access
  to the tool, because `validate_agent_write` only inspects the bindings
  actually submitted and the removed ref is not among them.
- **Published Agents**: the owner removes the binding *and* resubmits; an admin
  approves. Until that approval lands, non-owner invokers still run the old
  snapshot.

Two admin escape hatches when an owner is unresponsive or review will not land
in time:

- **Takedown** (`POST /api/admin/agents/{id}/takedown`). This clears
  `publishedVersion` ([`listing_service.py:1003`](../../backend/src/apis/app_api/agent_designer/services/listing_service.py#L1003)),
  which makes `resolve_invocation_agent` fall through to the **live record** for
  everyone. So a takedown *un-freezes* the snapshot: if the author has already
  fixed their draft, takedown makes the fix effective immediately. It is a
  delisting, not a revocation — pins and direct links keep working.
- **Rollback** (`POST /api/admin/agents/{id}/rollback`) is *not* a fix here.
  Older versions bind the same server.

Track the §5c scan to zero. Re-run it; do not trust the ticket.

**Rollback:** still trivial — nothing has been revoked.

### Stage 3 — Revoke. **The blast line**

Only once §5c returns zero, or once the remaining holdouts have been explicitly
accepted as breakage by their owners:

1. Remove the id from every role's `grantedTools`
   (`POST /api/admin/tools/{id}/roles/remove`, which writes through to each
   role record — the `allowedAppRoles` field on the tool is a derived
   projection and setting it grants nothing).
2. Set `isPublic: false`.
3. Confirm no wildcard role is still in play. A `*` grant keeps admins working
   past this step; that is expected and fine, but it means an admin's smoke test
   proves nothing about an ordinary user.

From this moment any Agent still binding the server hard-blocks for every
invoker on every turn, with the §1 message.

**Rollback:** re-add the grant. Access restores within one `AppRoleCache` cycle
plus the 10 s `freshness` TTL — call it a minute in the worst case. The state is
recoverable; the error messages already delivered are not. That asymmetry is why
Stage 3 gets its own line and its own announcement.

### Stage 4 — Remove the row. **The point of no return**

Order matters: grants are already gone (Stage 3), so there is no window in which
the §1 "silent capability loss" state exists.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$APP_API/api/admin/tools/$TOOL_ID?hard=true" -H "..."
```

For `protocol: mcp` (Gateway), `delete_tool` deletes the live AgentCore Gateway
target *before* the row ([`tools/service.py:663`](../../backend/src/apis/app_api/tools/service.py#L663)),
tolerating a 404. **That AWS call is irreversible**; re-creating the target
means re-running discovery and re-issuing credentials.

Three things `delete_tool` does **not** clean up. Do them by hand:

| Leftover | Why it survives | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `PK=TOOL#<id>, SK=CAPABILITIES` | `repository.delete_tool` deletes only `SK=METADATA`. `delete_capabilities` exists and has **zero callers** | `aws dynamodb delete-item` on that key |
| `ROLE#<role>/TOOL_GRANT#<id>` rows | `delete_tool` does not cascade into RBAC | Already gone if Stage 3 was done properly. **Verify** — a surviving grant plus a missing row is the §1 silent-failure state |
| `toolPreferences` keys, scheduled-run `enabledTools` entries | Never reconciled against the catalog | Leave them. Inert |

**Rollback:** re-create the row from `retirement-<id>-metadata.json` (Stage 0),
re-run discovery, re-create the Gateway target, re-add grants. Possible but it
is a rebuild, not an undo — and if Stage 0's export was skipped, the endpoint
and auth configuration are simply gone.

---

## 7. The change Stage 1 needs (shipped)

Small, additive, and involves no grant-layer divergence.

### The rule, stated once

> A non-`active` tool can be turned **off** but not **on**.

That asymmetry is the exact mirror of `alwaysOn`, which is on and cannot be
turned off, and both guards sit side by side in the same functions. Getting the
direction wrong in either half breaks the plan: block both directions and every
user who already has the tool is stranded with it; block neither and Stage 1
buys nothing.

Retirement is a property of the **server**, never of one of its tools —
`can_access_tool` keys on the base id — so a retiring server that is off cannot
be adopted one sub-tool at a time, while narrowing a server someone already has
stays open.

### Backend — `status`, plus the two fields that answer "then what?"

`bindable_catalog._list_tools` carries `status` on each `kind: "tool"` item's
`meta`. `BindableItem.meta` is a free-form `Dict[str, Any]`, so this breaks no
contract, and a `str`-Enum serialises as `"deprecated"` rather than an enum
member — which the SPA's `!== 'active'` comparison depends on.

`status` alone only says a tool is going away. Two nullable fields on
`ToolDefinition` say what to do about it, and ride the same path out through
`UserToolAccess`, `AdminToolResponse` and `BindableItem.meta`:

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `retirementNote` | Free text, ≤300 chars — *"Replaced by Canvas for Faculty"*, *"No replacement — contact OIT"* |
| `retiresOn` | ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; the day Stage 3 revokes the grant |

**Free text rather than a `replacedBy` tool id**, because a retirement often has
no drop-in successor, or splits across several, and an id cannot say so. A
structured pointer can be added later *underneath* this; it cannot replace it.

Both are **display only** — nothing reads them for access, and neither reaches
the model's `toolConfig`, so they cost nothing per turn. They are also not gated
on `status`: an admin may fill them in while drafting, and `isRetiring` alone
decides whether anything renders. Coupling them would discard a note typed
before the status was flipped.

`retiresOn` is stored as a string because it is displayed, never computed with —
which is exactly why it is validated on the way in. Without the guard, `"soon"`
or `"9/30/26"` would persist happily and reach the SPA.

`GET /tools/` already returned `status` on every `UserToolAccess`, so the chat
picker needed no backend change for that half.

**Nothing is filtered out.** `binding_validation._validate_tool` reads the same
`get_user_accessible_tools` as the palette, so dropping a retiring tool from
that list would 403 an author editing an Agent that keeps the binding — for a
tool that Agent can still run. §4 is the long form of this.

### SPA — one guard per surface that can newly adopt a tool

`isRetiring(tool)` in `services/tool/tool.service.ts` is the single predicate.
Absent or unknown `status` reads as active, so an older backend leaves every
picker exactly as it is today.

| Surface | Guard |
|---|---|
| Agent Designer (`agent-form.page`) | `isToolRetiring(item)` from `meta.status`; `toggleTool` refuses to select an unselected retiring ref; the row is `disabled` in that one direction, carries a `retiring` badge, and states the reason as **visible text** — PR #1233 replaced the chip cloud with a searchable list and moved this disclosure out of hover, because "hover-only text is dead on touch and cannot be scanned at all" |
| Customize → Tools (`customize-tools.page`, `customize-card.component`) | `retiring` input on the card: the switch is disabled **only while already off**; `onToggle` is the backstop behind it |
| Customize → Tools → detail (`customize-tool-detail.page`) | `isRetireLocked(tool)` on the master switch *and* on every sub-tool switch |
| New scheduled run (`schedule-form.page`) | `isToolRetiring(toolId)` on the checkbox. A schedule's `enabledTools` is a snapshot, so adding one here books it into a run that may fire months from now |
| `ToolService.toggleTool` / `toggleServerTool` | The service-level backstop all of the above sit on, for the keyboard and programmatic paths that never see a `disabled` attribute |
| Admin tool form | The two retirement inputs, revealed when Status leaves `active`. **Hidden, not disabled** — the controls keep their values, so toggling Status while drafting does not silently discard what was typed |

### One sentence, four surfaces

`retirementDetail()` composes the note and the date into the single sentence
each surface appends after its own lead-in. It exists so the Customize card, the
detail page, the Designer notice and the schedule chip cannot drift into four
phrasings of the same fact. Both fields are independently optional, so it has
four shapes and all four must stay grammatical:

| Recorded | Renders |
|---|---|
| note + date | *"Replaced by Canvas for Faculty. It stops working on October 31, 2026."* |
| note only | *"Replaced by Canvas for Faculty."* |
| date only | *"It stops working on October 31, 2026."* |
| neither | **nothing** |

The last row is deliberate. "No replacement is available" would be a claim
invented on the admin's behalf; absence of information is not information. The
Designer notice is the one exception — it falls back to *"It will stop working
once the retirement completes"*, because a notice with a blank second half reads
like a rendering bug.

⚠️ **The date is parsed at UTC noon.** `new Date('2026-10-31')` is midnight UTC
and prints as the 30th for every timezone west of Greenwich — which is all of
ours. A retirement date that reads a day early is the one kind of wrong here
that actually costs someone. `Date.UTC` also **rolls over** rather than failing
(`2026-13-45` becomes February 2027), so the parts are re-read and compared
after construction; the backend validator rejects that shape, but a hand-edited
DynamoDB item can still carry it.

**Nothing is hidden from a list.** An author who opens an Agent binding a
retiring server must *see* the binding — a ref that silently vanished from the
picker while remaining in the record is how a "why did my Agent break?" ticket
gets written three weeks later. The Agent Designer additionally renders a
section notice naming the retiring tools this agent still binds, because the
action we need (remove it, and resubmit if published) does not fit on a chip.

None of this is a security boundary — a crafted `PUT /agents/{id}` can still add
the binding. That is fine: the threat model is *accidental new adoption*, not a
determined author. The boundary stays in `can_access_tool`, and it moves only in
Stage 3.

### Compatibility on deploy — measured, not assumed

§7 gives `status` readers, so it is **not** inert against rows that are already
non-`active`. Measured against the live catalogs on 2026-09-21:

| Environment | Catalog | Effect of deploying §7 |
|---|---|---|
| **prod** (`boisestateai-v2-app-roles`) | 33 tools, **all `active`** | **Strict no-op.** Nothing changes for any user |
| **dev** (`dev-boisestateai-v2-app-roles`) | 25 `active`, 2 `disabled` — `pe12_probe_mcp` (`isPublic: true`) and `sk_hello_approval` | Those two stop being addable in every picker |

Both dev rows are probe servers, so that is the intended outcome rather than a
regression — but it is worth knowing it happens, and `pe12_probe_mcp` is a
textbook §3: `disabled` *and* `isPublic`, i.e. granted to every authenticated
user by a flag that `status` never overrode and still does not.

Re-run the check before deploying to any other environment:

```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name "$APP_ROLES_TABLE" --region us-west-2 \
  --filter-expression "begins_with(PK, :p) AND SK = :sk" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":p":{"S":"TOOL#"},":sk":{"S":"METADATA"}}' \
  --projection-expression "toolId,#s,isPublic" \
  --expression-attribute-names '{"#s":"status"}' --output json \
| jq -r '.Items[] | select(.status.S != "active") | "\(.status.S)\t\(.toolId.S)"'
```

Any row it prints is one whose pickers change on deploy. Flip it back to
`active` on the admin tool form if that is not what you want.

### Verified live against dev (2026-09-22, retirement metadata)

Branch code against dev's real catalog, with `retirementNote: "Replaced by Hello
World"` / `retiresOn: "2026-10-31"` set on `pe12_probe_mcp` (restored after).

| Surface | Observed |
|---|---|
| Customize card | *"Being retired and can no longer be turned on. Replaced by Hello World. It stops working on October 31, 2026."* — same string on the switch's `title` |
| Admin tool form | Block revealed because Status is Disabled, both inputs populated from the row |
| Admin form, Status → Active → Disabled | Block hides, then returns **with the value intact** — the "hidden, not disabled" claim |
| Designer notice, metadata set | *"PE12 Probe MCP is being retired. Replaced by Hello World. It stops working on October 31, 2026."* |
| Designer notice, metadata absent | *"SK Hello Approval Test is being retired. It will stop working once the retirement completes."* — the fallback, promising no date it cannot show |

⚠️ **Clearing a note stores `""`, not an absent attribute.** `repository.update_tool`
skips `None` (so `null` cannot clear a field) and `setattr`s the `""` straight onto
an already-constructed model, which does not re-run field validators. The value
normalises to `None` on the next `from_dynamo_item`, so all three read surfaces
report `null` and nothing renders — but the stored row is `""` rather than
missing. Harmless and self-healing; documented because a row diff will show it.

### Verified live against dev (2026-09-21)

Local branch code (SPA on `:4200`, app-api on `:8000`) against dev's real
catalog, which carries two `disabled` rows. All four states observed:

| State | Observed |
|---|---|
| Retiring, **not** enabled — Customize card | `retiring` badge, reason line, switch `disabled` + `aria-disabled="true"`, accessible name *"PE12 Probe MCP is being retired and can no longer be turned on"* |
| Retiring, **not** bound — Designer chip | `retiring` badge, chip `disabled`, still listed among the active chips |
| Retiring, **already bound** — Designer chip | Chip **selected**, **not** disabled, badge shown, sub-tool caret available; section notice named it and told the author to remove and resubmit |
| Removal | One click deselected it, the chip went `disabled` in the same frame (cannot be re-added), the notice disappeared, and Save enabled |
| `active` control (Calculator / Word Documents) | No badge, live switch/chip, unchanged `aria-label` |

Contrast, canvas-normalized (the tokens resolve to `oklch()`, which a naive
`rgb()` parse gets wrong):

| Theme | Reason line on card | Badge on badge fill |
|---|---|---|
| light | 5.03:1 | 4.85:1 |
| dark | 10.14:1 | 9.22:1 |

Both clear AA (4.5:1) at the 10px/12px sizes used — light mode with the smaller
margin, and identical token pairs to the existing `connected` / `connect`
badges, so the badge is no worse than the pattern it joins.

⚠️ The backend **accepted** a `POST /agents/` binding a `disabled` tool, as it
must — that is the design (§4), and it is what let this be verified with a
throwaway agent rather than a fixture. That agent was deleted; its partition
reads zero rows.

### What was deliberately left alone

`get_user_accessible_tools`, `_tool_grant_set`, `get_public_tool_ids` and
`_validate_tool` are all untouched. `test_public_tool_grants.py` and the rule it
guards are intact.

`reconcileToolRefs` already flagged non-`active` refs on template prefill and
still applied them — the right behaviour, and the precedent the badge copy
follows.

## 8. What to tell Agent authors

**Stage 1 — to every owner in §5c, and to the tool's known users:**

> **`<Server>` is being retired on `<date>`.**
> Nothing changes today. Your agent **`<Agent name>`** uses it and will keep
> working exactly as it does now.
> From today it can't be added to new agents, and it no longer appears as a
> choice in the tool picker.
> Before `<date>` please remove it from `<Agent name>` — and if your agent is
> published, resubmit it so the change reaches the people using it. After
> `<date>` an agent that still uses it will refuse to run and will tell your
> users to contact an administrator.
> Replacement: `<the replacement, or "none — here is what to do instead">`.

**Stage 2 — reminder to holdouts, and separately to published-Agent owners:**

> Your agent **`<name>`** is published, so the people using it are running the
> reviewed snapshot — removing the tool from your draft is not enough on its
> own. Please resubmit; we will prioritise the review. If you would rather not
> resubmit, tell us and we will take the listing down, which makes your current
> draft live for everyone immediately.

**Stage 3 — before revoking, to anyone still bound:**

> `<Server>` access is being removed `<date/time>`. `<N>` agents still use it and
> **will stop running** at that point, showing their users: *"This agent uses the
> tool `<id>`, which isn't available to your account."* This is the last notice.

**Stage 4:** internal only. No user-facing change beyond Stage 3.

## 9. Retiring a built-in tool instead (the seeder)

`DEFAULT_TOOLS` in `seed_bootstrap_data.py` contains **fourteen local/AWS-SDK
tool ids and no MCP servers**. Every `mcp` / `mcp_external` row is created by an
admin through `POST /admin/tools/`, so for the case this runbook covers the
seeder is **not** a resurrection risk.

It is for a built-in. `seed_default_tools`
([`seed_bootstrap_data.py:848`](../../backend/scripts/seed_bootstrap_data.py#L848))
does `get_item` → skip-if-present → else `put_item` with a hard-coded
`"status": "active"`. So a hard-deleted built-in row **comes back, active, on the
next bootstrap run**, and its `status: deprecated` is not preserved either way.
Retiring a built-in therefore adds one step to Stage 4: delete its `DEFAULT_TOOLS`
entry *and* its `TOOL_CATALOG` entry (`agents/main_agent/tools/tool_catalog.py`)
in the same PR, because `test_seed_matches_tool_catalog.py` asserts that a
catalogued tool without a seed row is a defect.

## 10. Follow-ups this runbook wants and does not have

1. **No reverse index tool → Agent.** §5c is a full table scan. Fine at today's
   Agent count; if that changes, the cheapest fix is a sparse GSI written from
   `bindings` at Agent-write time — or an admin endpoint that does the scan once
   and caches, so the runbook is a button rather than a `jq` incantation.
2. **`get_roles_for_tool` is blind to wildcard grants** (§5a). The "0 roles"
   badge on the admin tool page inherits that blindness and reads as "nobody has
   this", which is exactly wrong for the most-granted tools.
3. **`delete_tool` does not cascade.** It leaves `TOOL_GRANT#` rows and the
   `CAPABILITIES` row behind, and `delete_capabilities` has no callers. The
   grant leftovers are what make "just delete it" produce §1's silent-failure
   state.
4. **`soft_delete_tool` now has a side effect it does not advertise.** Since §7
   it performs Stage 1's status change, which is useful but is not what "Delete"
   reads as, and the Delete button cannot undo it (§2). The admin tool page
   should say what soft-delete now does.
5. **Deprecated bindings are invisible to admins.** There is no view answering
   "which Agents bind a non-`active` tool?", which is the report Stage 2 is
   actually managed from.
