# Response feedback

**Status:** PARTIALLY BUILT — capture and the read model shipped in PR #1142
(2026-09-16, as document-context-offload PR-7) and the consequence
(retry-with-correction) in the PR stacked on it; §11 PR-1 is therefore
complete, and §11 PR-2 (implicit signals) followed for copy and continue.
Eval sampling (§11 PR-4) followed too, opt-in per environment, and §11 PR-3's
config-dimension attribution now has a fleet page. The author surfaces are not
built. See §13. Written 2026-09-04 from the "how would we benefit?"
conversation.
**Refs:** `docs/specs/agentcore-evaluations-spike-findings.md` (the eval
harness this feeds), `docs/specs/mid-turn-steering.md` (the injection path
Phase 1 reuses), `docs/specs/agent-marketplace.md` D15 (the *other* feedback
channel — see §3), `docs/kaizen/research/2026-08-28.md` (built-in skill
evaluators)

## 1. Problem

Two commented-out lines have been sitting in the codebase for a long time:

```
backend/src/apis/shared/sessions/models.py:645   # Note: Feedback will be added in future implementation
backend/src/apis/shared/sessions/models.py:646   # feedback: Optional[Feedback] = None
backend/src/apis/app_api/messages/models.py:132  # Note: Feedback will be added in future implementation
backend/src/apis/app_api/messages/models.py:133  # feedback: Optional[Feedback] = None
```

Nothing was ever built behind them. The question this spec answers is not "can
we add a thumb" — that is an afternoon — but **what a thumb is worth here, and
what shape makes it worth that.**

The honest starting position is that thumbs data is usually near-worthless.
Coverage runs 1–5% of turns, skews negative, and a single down-thumb conflates
"factually wrong", "ignored my instructions", "far too long", and "the MCP tool
500'd and the model apologised". Anyone treating the raw rate as a KPI is
reading noise.

What changes the calculus here is the **join surface this platform already
has, and the one axis it is missing.**

Every model call already writes a `C#` row carrying model id, attribution,
cost breakdown, token usage, `cacheStatus`, `cacheGapSeconds`, `wastedUsd`,
and `agentSwitched`. There is an admin anatomy endpoint over it
(`GET /admin/costs/sessions/{id}/calls`), EMF metrics, a fleet dashboard, and
a five-workstream cost-effectiveness roadmap. **Cost is instrumented to three
decimal places. Quality is not instrumented at all.**

CLAUDE.md's cost tenet states: *"When cost and answer quality genuinely
conflict, quality wins."* Today there is no instrument that could ever detect
that conflict. Every compaction tuning decision, every model downgrade, every
context-offload threshold has been made against a cost number with quality
asserted rather than measured. A thumb is the cheapest possible counterweight.

## 2. The thesis

> **Feedback is a sampler and a label. It is not a metric.**

Three consequences follow, and they drive every decision below:

1. **As a sampler:** a down-thumb marks the small subset of turns worth
   spending expensive LLM-judge tokens on. The Evaluations spike proved the
   judging pipeline works end to end today, but judging is per-trace and
   costs real money — it cannot run fleet-wide. Human-marked failures are the
   priority queue that makes it affordable.
2. **As a label:** joined against the config dimensions already stamped on
   every call, a down-thumb answers questions currently unanswerable — does
   quality actually drop after compaction? is Sonnet worth 3× Haiku on *this*
   workload? Relative comparison between config arms, never absolute rates.
3. **Never as a metric:** the absolute rate over a self-selected 3% means
   nothing. It must not appear on any leadership dashboard as a quality score.
   §9 makes this a hard rule, not a caution.

## 3. What this is NOT — de-conflicting with agent reports

Marketplace Phase 8 (D15) already shipped a feedback channel, and it is a
different object. `AgentReport` (`apis/shared/assistants/models.py:1621`) is
agent-scoped, free-text, identity-bearing, and lands in a **moderation queue**
sorted by `REPORT_REASON_SEVERITY`. `ReportReason` deliberately includes
`suggestion` so that a user who does not know whether they hit a defect or a
missing capability is not asked to pick the right intake form. It surfaces as
`app-agent-feedback-link` at the foot of a conversation
(`message-list.component.html`, `showFeedbackLink()`), published agents only.

Response feedback is **per-message, fixed-set, high-volume, and analytical.**
It has no queue and no moderator. Nobody reads an individual down-thumb.

| | Agent report (D15, shipped) | Response feedback (this spec) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | One published Agent | One assistant message |
| Volume | Rare, hand-written | Frequent, one click |
| Consumer | A human admin, one at a time | Aggregation + the eval harness |
| Identity | `reporterId` shown to admin, never to author | Same rule (§8) |
| Surface | Foot of conversation, published agents only | Every assistant message |

**They must not be merged, and they must not both shout.** The conversation
tail can hold one report link and per-message thumbs without collision, but the
down-thumb reason sheet must include an escape hatch — *"this is a problem with
the Agent itself"* — that hands off to the existing report dialog rather than
inventing a second moderation path. That handoff is the only coupling.

## 4. What already exists

Almost every mechanism this needs is built for another reason.

**A per-message row family keyed the right way.** `sessions-metadata` already
holds two SK prefixes under `PK = USER#<user_id>`: `C#` cost rows
(`SK C#{timestamp}#{uuid}`, `GSI_SK C#{timestamp}`, carrying `messageId`) and
`D#` display rows (`SK D#{session_id}#{message_id}`, `GSI_SK D#{message_id}`).
The `D#` row is the closer model: deterministic key, one row per message, no
collision uuid. A feedback row is a third prefix in a table that already
supports it, with a `GSI_PK = SESSION#<id>` read path that already exists.

**A reader that already unions prefixes.** `get_session_cost_anatomy`
(`admin/costs/routes.py:183`) queries `C#` and `D#` in parallel over
`SessionLookupIndex` (`metadata.py:1987`). Adding `F#` is a third leg of a
query that is already fan-out shaped.

**A verified evaluation pipeline.** Per the Evaluations spike: 16 built-in
`ACTIVE` evaluators, `EvaluationClient.run()` returning scored results with
explanations quoting real dev conversation text, and — critically — session
correlation that needs no new plumbing, since
`runtime_session_id_for()` (`apis/shared/harness/runner.py:63`) is
`sid-<sha256(session_id)>`. A feedback row carrying `sessionId` +
`messageId` is already joinable to the spans.

**Built-in skill evaluators.** `Builtin.SkillSelectionAccuracy` and
`Builtin.SkillInstructionFollowing` (2026-08-28 research) target the exact
failure mode the Skills v2 epic left unmeasured. They need a sampling signal
to be affordable.

**An injection path for the retry loop.** `POST /sessions/{id}/steer`
(`app_api/sessions/routes.py:741`) already accepts a correction into a turn,
gated by `mid_turn_steering_enabled()`. "Retry with this correction" is the
same shape aimed at a finished turn instead of a running one.

**A place to put the buttons.** `message-actions.component.ts` already renders
Copy and Continue under every assistant message. Thumbs belong in that rail,
not in a new component.

**A precedent for attaching conversation content to feedback.**
`report_service.file_report` verifies an attached `sessionId` belongs to the
reporter before storing it. Reuse that check verbatim.

## 5. Decision summary

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Storage | Third SK prefix `F#` on `sessions-metadata`, **never** on the message itself |
| Key | `SK F#{session_id}#{message_id}`, `GSI_SK F#{message_id}` — deterministic, idempotent upsert |
| Mutability | Overwrite in place. Changing or clearing your mind is a normal act, not an audit event |
| Signal set | `up` / `down` + optional fixed-set reason + optional free text |
| Reason set | Fixed and small (§6). Free text is secondary and never required |
| Prompt cache | Feedback is a pure side-channel write. It never enters conversation history, `toolConfig`, or the system prompt |
| Consequence | Phase 1 ships a **visible** consequence (retry-with-correction), not a suggestion box |
| Implicit signals | Captured in the same row family, same phase. They are denser than thumbs and cost no UI |
| LLM-judged signals | Offline batch over persisted turns only. Never an inline per-turn model call |
| Reporting | Relative comparison between config arms. Absolute rate is never published as a quality score |
| Identity | Stored. Visible to admins with the scope; never to an agent author |
| Flag | `RESPONSE_FEEDBACK_ENABLED`, default on with a kill switch (house convention) |

## 6. The signal set

Down-thumb opens a chip row. One tap, no typing, dismissible:

- **Wrong or made up** → routes to `Correctness` / `Faithfulness` evaluators
- **Didn't follow my instructions** → `InstructionFollowing`
- **Too long / too short** → a style signal, and a Memory Spaces input (§7)
- **A tool or search failed** → **ops, not model.** Auto-corroborated against
  the turn's `tool_result` blocks
- **Out of date** → KB freshness; joins to `kb_sync` state
- **Something else** → free text

The mapping to evaluators is the point of a fixed set. An unbucketed
down-thumb is noise; a bucketed one is a routing decision.

Up-thumb takes no reason. Asking for one on a positive signal collapses the
response rate and buys almost nothing.

## 7. What it unlocks

### Platform

**Negative-sample mining.** Down-thumbed turns become the eval harness's input
queue. This flips the harness from "run against a synthetic suite someone wrote"
to "run against observed real-world failures" — a categorically better asset,
and the reason this spec is worth more than the sum of its UI.

**Config-dimension attribution.** The prize. Join down-thumb rate against
dimensions already on the `C#` row and against session state:

- **Compaction.** Does quality degrade after a compaction event? Today there is
  a `compaction` SSE event, a checkpoint, and a truncation anchor — and zero
  evidence about whether users notice. The compaction-death-spiral incident
  cost a faculty member $27 of a $30 quota in five days; nobody knows what it
  cost in answer quality.
- **Model.** Haiku vs Sonnet per workload, measured rather than assumed.
- **`agentSwitched`.** The `@`-mention history fork is a known cache cost. Is
  it also a quality cost?
- **KB freshness.** Do stale-sync assistants draw more "out of date"?
- **Skills.** Which granted skills correlate with down-thumbs, as the cheap
  pre-filter for `SkillSelectionAccuracy`.

**Rework cost.** Sum the call cost of a down-thumbed turn plus the retries that
follow it. This denominates quality in dollars, on the dashboards that already
exist. Strategically this is the most valuable single number in the spec: it
makes quality legible in the budget conversation instead of being the thing we
assert but cannot defend.

**Marketplace ranking and version regression.** Store tiles rank on nothing
user-derived. A helpfulness rate per **published `AgentVersion`** gives ranking
*and* an alarm when a new version's rate drops — a trigger for the §8 rollback
path that currently has no automated reason to fire.

**Tool and MCP health.** "A tool failed" + an errored `tool_result` is an ops
alert, not a model signal. Worth noting that dev ran with zero working MCP
tools for weeks and nothing surfaced it.

**Preference data.** A `fine_tuning` domain already exists, and paired
up/down on the same prompt is DPO-shaped. Explicitly **out of scope until
Phase 5** and gated on a policy decision, not an engineering one (§8).

### User

**The retry loop is the actual user-facing feature.** A down-thumb that offers
*"retry with that in mind"* turns feedback from a suggestion box into a
steering act: the user gets a better answer in seconds, and we get a labeled
pair for free. Ship the thumb without this and the response rate decays to
zero within weeks — at which point the data is too sparse to use and the whole
spec is dead. **The consequence is not a Phase 2 nicety; it is the thing that
keeps Phase 1 alive.**

**Personalization.** Repeated "too long" → a durable style preference in a
Memory Space. The primitive exists; this is the missing input to it.

**Agent authors are a distinct user class.** A marketplace publisher currently
receives no signal about whether their instructions and tool bindings work in
the wild. Aggregate-only, never per-user (§8).

## 8. Governance

An admin reading a down-thumbed turn is an admin reading someone's
conversation. Three rules:

1. **Aggregates by default; content behind a scope.** Rate, reason
   distribution, and config joins need no content. Reading the actual message
   requires a delegated-admin scope (`granular-admin-permissions.md`) and
   writes an audit row.
2. **Authors get substance, never identity.** Same rule as D15.2, for the same
   reason: authors need to know what went wrong, admins need identity to spot a
   brigade.
3. **Training use is a separate consent decision.** Aggregation and evaluation
   are platform operation. Building a preference dataset from user
   conversations is not, and it does not ride in on this spec's flag. Per the
   governance-via-identity-claims principle, that gate belongs at the claim
   level, decided before Phase 5 is scoped — not inferred from the fact that
   the rows exist.

## 9. Risks and the rules that answer them

| Risk | Rule |
|---|---|
| Someone publishes the raw rate as a quality KPI | Aggregate endpoints return **comparisons between arms**, and every response carries its `n` and coverage %. No single-number "quality score" field exists to be quoted |
| Sparse, self-selected, negative-skewed data | Treat as a sampler. Implicit signals (§10) carry the density; thumbs carry the intent |
| Feedback write mutates the cacheable prefix | Structural: `F#` is its own DynamoDB item. Nothing in this spec touches conversation history, `toolConfig`, or the system prompt. A design that puts feedback on the message object is rejected for this reason |
| An inline LLM judge is added "just to classify" | Batch/offline over persisted turns only. An inline per-turn model call on every session for the life of the platform is exactly what the cost tenet exists to stop |
| Two feedback affordances confuse users | The report link stays agent-scoped at the tail; thumbs are per-message. The down-thumb sheet hands off to the report dialog rather than duplicating it (§3) |
| Feedback becomes a void | Phase 1 ships the consequence with the button, or Phase 1 does not ship |

## 10. Implicit signals

Denser than thumbs, ~100% coverage, and free of UI cost:

- **Copy to clipboard** — already a click in `message-actions.component.ts`
- **Continue** on a truncated or interrupted response
- **Edit-and-resend** of the preceding user message
- **Abandonment** — session goes idle immediately after a response
- **Dissatisfaction in the *next* user message** — the strongest dense proxy,
  and the one that most needs the offline-batch rule from §9

These write the same `F#` row family with a `signal: "implicit"` discriminator.
Explicit and implicit must never be summed into one rate; they answer
different questions and have wildly different base rates.

## 11. Phasing

Sized so each phase is independently shippable and each earns the next.

**PR-1 — Capture + consequence.** `F#` row, `POST/DELETE
/sessions/{id}/messages/{message_id}/feedback` on **app-api** (per the
inference-api boundary rule), thumbs in `message-actions.component.ts`, the
reason sheet, and retry-with-correction. Uncomment and fill the `Feedback`
model at the two placeholder sites. Flag `RESPONSE_FEEDBACK_ENABLED`.
*User value on day one; no analytics build.*

**PR-2 — Implicit signals.** Copy / continue / edit-resend / abandonment into
the same row family. *Density.*

**PR-3 — Read model + admin panel.** Third leg on the anatomy query; a quality
panel beside the cost panels, joined to model / compaction / `agentSwitched` /
skills. *The attribution payoff.*

**PR-4 — Eval sampling.** Down-thumbed turns feed `EvaluationClient.run()`,
routed to evaluators by reason bucket. *Makes judging affordable.*

**PR-5 — Author and marketplace surfaces.** Per-version helpfulness rate,
regression alarm against the rollback path.

**Phase 6 (not scoped) — preference dataset.** Policy-gated per §8, and only
if PR-3 proves the signal is real.

## 12. Open questions

1. **Does the retry-with-correction path reuse `/steer` or need its own?**
   `/steer` targets a *running* turn via the lease row. Correcting a finished
   turn is a normal new turn carrying a structured preamble. Probably a
   different endpoint with the same UX — worth confirming before PR-1.
2. **Does a corrected retry write a linked pair?** It should, for Phase 6 —
   but that is the training-consent question, so PR-1 may need to record the
   link without recording the content.
3. **Coverage floor for publishing a comparison.** Below some `n`, an arm
   comparison is theatre. Pick the number before the panel exists, not after
   someone dislikes a result.
4. **Do preview sessions participate?** The `D#` write skips them
   (`metadata.py:156`); the `C#` cost write has **no such guard**, so the two
   prefixes already disagree — settle the rule for `F#` deliberately rather
   than copying whichever neighbour is read first. Agent Designer previews are
   exactly where an author would want to thumb their own work, but that data
   must never reach fleet aggregates.

## 13. Built — PR #1142 (2026-09-16)

Shipped as the outcome signal of `document-context-offload.md` §5 row 7, so
it was built against that spec's content-free rule first and reconciled with
this one after. What landed, and the decisions it took on this spec's open
points:

- **Storage exactly per §5**: `F#{session_id}#{message_id}` on
  `sessions-metadata`, `GSI_SK F#{message_id}`, idempotent upsert, overwrite
  in place, never on the message object (`apis/shared/sessions/feedback.py`).
  Rows carry `signal: "explicit"` from day one so §10's implicit rows can
  join the family without a backfill; every thumb reader filters on it, so
  the two are never summed (§10's rule, enforced).
- **Routes** `PUT`/`DELETE /sessions/{id}/messages/{message_id}/feedback` on
  app-api (PUT rather than POST: the write is an upsert). Flag
  `RESPONSE_FEEDBACK_ENABLED`, default on with a kill switch.
- **Reason set = §6's six buckets as codes** (`wrong`, `instructions`,
  `length`, `tool_failed`, `outdated`, `other`). **Free text is not stored,
  and this is a decision, not an omission**: the row sits beside the `C#`
  cost row and is read by the content-free admin profile, whose test walks
  the projection against the denylist. "Something else → free text" is
  served by the §3 hand-off to the Agent report dialog, which already has
  moderation and a scope. Revisit only together with §8 rule 1.
- **Read model**: the session profile (`GET /admin/costs/sessions/{id}/profile`)
  joins thumbs to the call's document turn class with `n` per bucket
  (§9's "every response carries its n"); `dataCoverage.feedback` says when
  nothing is tracked. The other §7 attribution axes (model, compaction,
  `agentSwitched`, skills) are further buckets in the same join loop.
- **Open question 4 settled**: preview sessions echo the thumb and persist
  nothing, matching the `D#` write. Preview data never reaches aggregates.
- **Retry-with-correction (the consequence), second PR.** Open question 1
  settled: **a new turn, not `/steer`** — the steer path targets a *running*
  turn through the lease row, and a finished turn is corrected by an
  ordinary next message. The down-thumb reason row offers *Retry with that
  in mind*, which prefills the composer (`ComposerDraftService`) with a
  correction template for the reason code; the user edits and sends it as a
  normal message, so it goes where messages go (AgentCore Memory) and never
  touches the metadata table. When that message is added, the send path
  links it to the thumb as `retryMessageId` on the `F#` row — an index,
  never the text — and a later re-thumb keeps the link. This is open
  question 2's answer for now: the pair is *recorded* without its content,
  so Phase 6 can find it once the consent decision is made. The profile
  reports `feedback.retried` and `reworkUsd` (§7 "rework cost": the thumbed
  call rows plus the retry turn's consecutive assistant rows).
- **Implicit signals (§11 PR-2), third PR — copy and continue only.**
  Same `F#` family under their own key, `F#{session}#{message}#{kind}`, so
  they never collide with the thumb; `signal: "implicit"`, `kind`, and an
  `ADD`ed `count`. `POST /sessions/{id}/messages/{message_id}/signals`,
  fire-and-forget from the SPA (the Copy and Continue clicks in the actions
  rail, once per message per kind per page load). The profile reports
  `feedback.implicit` as *messages touched* per kind, on its own line — the
  §10 rule that explicit and implicit are never summed is enforced in every
  reader. Two of §10's four signals are deliberately not here:
  **edit-and-resend** has no affordance in the SPA to hook, and
  **abandonment** is deferred — a session that goes quiet after a good
  answer is indistinguishable from one that goes quiet after a bad one, so
  it needs its own design (or the §10 "dissatisfaction in the next message"
  offline classifier) before it is worth a row.
- **Eval sampling (§11 PR-4), fourth PR — opt-in.** Down-thumbs carry
  `GSI1PK = FEEDBACK#down` / `GSI1SK = updatedAt` on the existing
  `UserTimestampIndex`, so the fleet's recent down-thumbs are one query with
  no new index. `POST /admin/feedback/evaluations/run` (scope `admin.costs`)
  judges up to N not-yet-judged ones in a background task through
  `bedrock_agentcore.evaluation.EvaluationClient` over the runtime log
  group, keyed by the runtime session id the chat proxy already pins;
  `GET /admin/feedback/evaluations` is the queue with verdicts. Routing is
  §6's table: `wrong` → Correctness + Faithfulness, `instructions` →
  InstructionFollowing, `length` → Conciseness, `other`/none → Helpfulness;
  `tool_failed` gets **no judge** and is corroborated against the call's
  tool census on the `C#` row (ops, not model); `outdated` gets no judge yet
  (the KB-freshness join is a follow-up). The verdict stored on the `F#` row
  is per-evaluator value / rating / n / tokens — **the judge's `explanation`
  is dropped at summarisation, refused at the storage write, and denylisted
  in the content policy**, because it quotes the conversation. The profile
  shows `feedback.evaluations` (judged, mean per evaluator, tool failures
  corroborated). **Default OFF** (`FEEDBACK_EVAL_SAMPLING_ENABLED`,
  `CDK_FEEDBACK_EVAL_SAMPLING_ENABLED=true` to enable): the managed judge
  reads the sampled conversation's spans, which is the scoping decision the
  evaluations spike (§2) says to make explicitly per environment, and §8
  rule 1 here. The IAM grant (Logs Insights on the runtime log group and
  `aws/spans`; Evaluate / GetEvaluator) is wired but inert until an
  environment opts in. Runs are admin-triggered; a schedule can follow once
  a week of verdicts says the token spend is worth it.
- **Fleet attribution (§11 PR-3, §7 "config-dimension attribution"), fifth
  PR.** `GET /admin/feedback/fleet?days=` aggregates a trailing window of
  thumbs into arms on four dimensions: **model**, **agent switch**,
  **distance from a compaction cut** (the compaction spec's §7.2 question,
  bucketed in model calls: never / same call / 1-3 / 4+), and **document
  turn class**. The window is a range read on the `FEEDBACK#down` /
  `FEEDBACK#up` partitions, then one cost-row query per session to join;
  both are capped (2,000 thumbs, 300 sessions) and exceeding either is
  reported as `coverage.truncated` / `sessionsOmitted` rather than silently
  under-counted. `/admin/feedback` renders it, under the `admin.costs` scope.
  §9 is enforced rather than promised: **every arm carries its own `n`**, an
  arm under the floor returns `downRate: null` so there is no number to
  quote, and **no fleet-wide rate field exists** at any level — the page
  states the gap between the two furthest-apart reportable arms instead of a
  score. Open question 3 is answered: the floor is **20**, picked because
  below it one extra thumb swings the rate by more than five points; it is
  env-tunable with `FEEDBACK_ARM_MINIMUM_N`.
  Two deviations from §11 PR-3 as written. It is **a page of its own, not a
  panel beside the cost panels** — the cost drill-down is per conversation
  and this question is fleet-shaped, so co-locating them would have meant a
  panel that ignored the session in whose page it sat. And the **skills axis
  is not built**: `enabledTools` lives on the session row, not the `C#` row,
  so a per-call skills arm needs either a denormalisation at write time or a
  second join, and neither is worth doing before the signal is proven.
- **Not built**: author/marketplace surfaces (PR-5), the report-dialog
  escape hatch in the reason row, abandonment, the `outdated` → KB-freshness
  join, a schedule for the sampler, the skills arm, and implicit signals in
  the fleet view (their rows carry no `GSI1*` keys, so they are invisible to
  the window query by construction — wiring them in is a follow-up to PR-2).
