# Scoping the quality-veto harness — what it is, what already exists, and the cheapest first slice

**Status:** Slice 1 BUILT 2026-09-25: `backend/scripts/compaction_quality_harness.py` (+ `compaction_quality/`, tests in `backend/tests/test_compaction_quality_harness.py`). The open questions in §6 are answered in §7. The missed-free-apply fix (§7.4) has landed. **The first full run is done (§8): the cut passes, and the summary compression fails.**
**Prompted by:** the two waivers recorded 2026-09-21 (`compaction-model-relative-thresholds.md` §5,
`document-offload-evaluation.md` §2), both of which name "build the harness" as trigger 1 — the only
path to an answer that does not wait on user volume.
**Design is not in scope here.** It is already written, in three places:
`compaction-over-threshold-cache-spiral.md` §4.3, `document-offload-evaluation.md` §2.1–2.4, and
`agentcore-evaluations-spike-findings.md` §2–3. This document does not redesign them. It answers the
question those specs never did: **what is the smallest thing we can build that produces a real
number, and in what order.**

---

## 1. Why it never got built, stated plainly

It is the one deliverable in either epic that ships no user-visible behaviour, and it lost to every
PR that did. Both specs assumed a single harness serving both, which made it one large project with
no owner rather than several small ones with obvious first steps.

The cheap substitute is now gone too. `GET /admin/feedback/fleet` already computes the comparison
both specs want (`arms.turnClass`, bucketed full > retrieved > digestOnly) — and returns nothing,
because prod carries **13 `F#` rows, one of which is a thumb**, against a floor of 20 per arm across
three arms. That is measured, 2026-09-21, and it is why this is worth scoping rather than deferring
again.

---

## 2. The finding that changes the sequencing

The specs and the spike both describe one harness driving live multi-turn sessions through the
deployed runtime, for both epics. **That is right for offload and substantially wrong for
compaction**, and nobody noticed because the two were always scoped together.

### 2.1 The compaction cut is a pure function — no runtime, no deploy, no env change

`CompactionPolicy.resolve(config, context_window)` and `choose_checkpoint(messages, cutoffs,
protected_turns, floor_tokens, history_tokens)` (`session/compaction_policy.py:77,199`) take a
`CompactionConfig` **object** and a message list. They read no environment at call time. So both arms
can be constructed in-process:

```python
relative = CompactionConfig(model_relative_enabled=True,  ceiling_ratio=0.5, floor_ratio=0.25, ...)
fixed    = CompactionConfig(model_relative_enabled=False, token_threshold=...)
```

Apply each to the *same* synthetic transcript, and the two cut points fall out deterministically.
No session, no runtime, no quota, no 60 live turns. The model is needed only for (a) generating the
bounded summary once per arm (`compaction_summary.bound_summary`, a Nova Micro call) and (b) one
answer per (task, arm) on the resulting history.

**What this removes:** the dominant cost of the compaction half. The spec's shape — "simulate long
editing sessions (30–60 turns)" — reads as 60 live turns × 2 arms × k=3. It does not have to be. A
synthetic transcript with planted constraints is *authored*, not generated, which is also the only
way the planted facts are known ground truth.

### 2.2 The offload arms genuinely need the runtime

The thing under test is whether the model **calls `document_read` when it needs to** and answers
correctly from what comes back. That is the agent loop, not a context shape you can assemble offline.
Arms B and C need real sessions.

### 2.3 ⚠️ The arm runner generalizes on transport, NOT on the arm mechanism

The spike says *"extend `experiment_agent_cache_arms.py`, don't rebuild it."* Half right — and the
half that is wrong is the half that matters. Read before planning around it:

| Part | Generalizes? |
|---|---|
| `run_arm()` — N sequential turns in one session via `run_agent_headless` | **Yes.** Prompts are a module constant; a task corpus is a parameter change. |
| `attach_cost_rows()` — reads `C#` rows back via `SessionLookupIndex` | **Yes**, directly. This is the token/cost instrument for any arm. |
| `attach_agent_cache_outcomes()` — CloudWatch log scrape | Agent-cache specific. Ignore. |
| **The arm definition** — `ARMS` is a dict of `enabled_tools` lists | **No.** This is the blocker. |

That script's arms differ by `enabled_tools` precisely because its docstring says *"the arms need no
redeploy"* — a deliberate trick for that experiment, not a general mechanism. `run_agent_headless`
(`apis/shared/harness/runner.py:136`) exposes `model_id`, `rag_assistant_id`, `enabled_tools`,
`agent_type`, `inference_params` — mirroring `InvocationRequest` — and **nothing else**. There is no
compaction or document knob on it.

Consequences, per epic:

- **Compaction**: `CompactionConfig.from_env()` reads
  `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_COMPACTION_CEILING_RATIO` / `_FLOOR_RATIO` /
  `COMPACTION_MODEL_RELATIVE_ENABLED` from the inference-api runtime environment. Two arms on one
  runtime is **not possible** through the live path. §2.1 is the way out: don't use the live path.
- **Offload, B vs C**: `offload_enabled_for()` buckets on `crc32(session_id) % 100`, so the PR-4 arm
  **can** be selected per session by choosing session ids that hash into or out of the bucket — no
  deploy. Genuinely useful, and free.
- **Offload, A vs B**: `DOCUMENT_REHYDRATE_ENABLED` / `DOCUMENT_READ_ENABLED` /
  `DOCUMENT_DIGEST_ENABLED` are plain global env flags. A-vs-B needs a runtime env change between
  arms — sequential arms, not concurrent, with the temporal-drift caveat that implies.

---

## 3. The slice that needs no judge

Both specs bury the same fact under their holistic-judge designs: **two of the three families in each
are programmatically generatable *and* programmatically scorable.**

| Spec | Judge-free families | Needs a judge |
|---|---|---|
| Compaction (spiral §4.3) | constraint retention, reference lookup | revision continuity (rubric) |
| Offload (eval §2.1) | lookup, citation | holistic (rubric, blinded) |

Planted constraints, known decisions, known page numbers — scoring is exact match against ground
truth we authored. Both specs say so directly ("programmatically generatable and scorable… so scale
n there"), and both then put the expensive third family first in the write-up, which is why the whole
thing reads as judge infrastructure.

It is also where the statistical power lives. The spiral spec's own sizing note: ~40 paired binary
tasks detects only a ~25-point regression; ≥100 is what makes a subtle regression visible, and ≥100
is affordable **only** in the programmatic families.

**So slice 1 needs: no blinded judge, no scrubber, no AgentCore Evaluations, no LLM-judging spend.**
A corpus, a cut, and exact-match scoring.

---

## 4. Proposed sequence

### Slice 1 — compaction, constraint retention + reference lookup (offline)

The whole slice runs on a laptop against pure functions plus two model calls per arm.

1. **Corpus** (`backend/scripts/` + a fixtures dir): author a parameterised 40–60 turn editing
   transcript. Constraints planted at known turns ("never change the thesis wording", "citation style
   X"), decisions stated once at a known turn. Generate ≥100 task instances by varying plant position,
   constraint type, and the turn the question is asked at. Deterministic, seeded.
2. **Arms**: two `CompactionConfig` objects. Apply `resolve` + `choose_checkpoint` to the same
   transcript; produce two post-cut histories. Generate each arm's bounded summary once via
   `bound_summary`.
3. **Ask**: one Converse call per (task, arm) on the post-cut history. k=3 at production temperature.
4. **Score**: exact match / containment against the planted ground truth. Paired, per family,
   McNemar. Report `n` per family; no pooled score.

**Output**: the first quality number either epic has ever had, and the thing that either deletes the
compaction waiver or fires its veto.

### Slice 2 — offload, lookup + citation (live, B vs C only)

Reuses slice 1's scoring and statistics; adds the corpus of documents with planted facts on known
pages, and the live arm runner. B-vs-C via crc32 session-id selection — **no deploy**. Per the
readout's prediction that PR-4 fires ≈0 times, run the mechanism check first: if `document_offload`
events are zero, this slice is measuring nothing and should stop.

### Slice 3 — A vs B, and the rubric families

Only after 1 and 2 have produced numbers. This is where the runtime env change per arm, the blinded
pairwise judge, and the scrubber live — i.e. all the infrastructure, deferred behind two slices that
do not need it. ⚠️ Blinding cannot go through AgentCore Evaluations: arm C transcripts carry
`document_read` calls and `<document-digest>` blocks that give the arm away, and feeding the evaluator
whole spans *is* the mechanism — there is no scrubbing seam (spike §2). This judge is ours or it is
not blinded.

⚠️ **Score A→B and B→C separately** whenever both are in play. Per the offload spec §5, PRs 1–3 are a
*correctness* fix where quality should go **up**, and only PR-4 is the cost trade. Pooling lets a
strip-fix win mask an offload regression.

---

## 5. What this is not

- **Not a replacement for the thumbs.** Different question. This measures a controlled arm difference
  on a synthetic corpus; `F#` rows measure real users on real work. The waivers' trigger 2 stands.
- **Not prod data.** Spike §2's scoping note applies in reverse here: the corpus is ours and contains
  no user content, which is exactly why the `body` payload reaching an AWS-managed evaluator is a
  non-issue. **If anyone later points this at recorded production conversations, that is a new
  decision** — do not let it happen by reusing the script.
- **Not a fleet quality score.** Per response-feedback spec §9, every number is a comparison between
  arms with its `n`, or it is not reported.

---

## 6. Open questions for whoever picks this up

1. **Does the authored transcript reproduce the cut the real path takes?** Slice 1 stands or falls on
   this. `choose_checkpoint` rescales per-message estimates to `history_tokens`, so the synthetic
   transcript must supply a realistic measured history size, not just realistic text. Verify against
   one real session's `C#` rows before trusting any slice-1 number.
2. **Is `bound_summary` reachable offline** without the session manager's surrounding state? It is
   `async` and takes a model; it looked self-contained but was not exercised.
3. **What is the control for compaction?** The spec says "the fixed-threshold arm." Confirm that
   `model_relative_enabled=False` reproduces pre-#1125 behaviour exactly, rather than approximately —
   if it does not, the control is a third policy and the comparison means something narrower.

---

## 7. Slice 1 as built (2026-09-25)

### 7.1 Shape

`cut` (free) → `records` / `ask` (spend, estimate first, `--yes` to run) → `score` (free).

- The corpus is seeded and authored. It is 48-turn grant-proposal editing
  sessions with 9 facts planted per transcript, across four families:
  `constraint`, `decision`, `reference` and `superseded`. `superseded` is new,
  and fails an answer that repeats the old value.
- The arms are `full` (the control), `model_relative`, `legacy` and `floor_50`.
  Each is an explicit `CompactionConfig`. Nothing is read from the environment.
- The paces are `restore` (rebuild every turn with a cold cache), `cold` (a
  warm agent with every gap past the TTL) and `warm` (every gap inside it).
- The summary modes are `fallback` (production's first-line summary), `none`,
  and `records`. `records` stands in for AgentCore's summary records: one
  model-written record per 8 turns, lagging one turn. It is an approximation,
  so label any number it produces.
- **Nothing reimplements the cut.** Each arm drives a bare
  `TurnBasedSessionManager` through `update_after_turn`,
  `apply_pending_compaction` and, on the restore pace, `_apply_compaction`.
  Only the I/O is stubbed: DynamoDB, LTM retrieval, EMF and the clock.
- `cut` also writes a free **availability** table: whether each planted value
  is still anywhere in the probe-time context. That is an upper bound on what
  any model can answer.
- `ask` puts a cachePoint after the shared history, so repeat questions on a
  history are cache reads. The dev smoke run wrote 311k tokens and read
  2.49M.

### 7.2 Answers to §6

1. **Realistic cut?** It is sized so that one 48-turn session crosses the
   100k ceiling once or twice, and so that the full history still fits a 200k
   window. Compare it against the prod readout (§7.4): prod cuts retained a
   median of 37k tokens. The harness lands under 25k because authored turns
   are uniform. Prod's deeper tail comes from single agentic turns larger
   than the floor, which this corpus does not model.
2. **Is `bound_summary` reachable offline?** Yes. It runs inside
   `update_after_turn` unchanged. The model path (`--summary-model`) needs AWS.
3. **Control?** Not the kill switch. See spec §5: the summary is still bounded
   with the switch off, and `legacy` keeps fewer turns than `model_relative`.
   The control is `full`.

### 7.3 Lesson from building it

The first clock stub backdated every save by the pace's gap, and that
**hid a production bug**. A stub for time has to stamp *now* the way
`_save_compaction_state` does, and apply the gap only between turns. The fix
reads the turn's gap from a stamp captured before any head-of-turn save, and
`test_restore_pace_applies_the_parked_cut_for_free` now holds it in place.

### 7.4 Prod readout, 2026-09-25 (aggregate, read-only, ~4 days after 1.23.0)

- **Scale:** 74 cuts in 44 sessions, about 4% of active sessions.
- **Guards held:** hysteresis held, no summary exceeded 8k, and no cut applied
  inside the TTL.
- **Missed free apply:** on a restore, `_maybe_advance_truncation_anchor`
  saves (stamping `updatedAt`) before the head-of-turn
  `apply_pending_compaction` reads the gap. The gap reads about 0 s, and the
  parked cut waits for the paid hard-ceiling apply. About half of the
  compacted sessions still held a parked cut.
- **Retained after a cut:** median 37k, p90 129k. The floor was unreachable on
  about 64% of cuts.
- **Forced cuts:** about 22% of cuts. They are mostly single agentic turns
  that grow past the ceiling; compaction acts only between turns.
- **Summary source:** `ltm` on every sampled last cut. Model-compressed
  summaries go from a median of ~20k to ~760 tokens. **That compression is the
  first thing the full run should score.** Use `records` mode with records
  large enough to trigger it, plus `--summary-model`.
- **Measurement gaps:**
  - the per-call `compactionEvents` ledger records only ~57% of cuts;
  - `prefixTokens` is unusable;
  - `contextBreakdown` is absent in prod;
  - the per-cut EMF carries no session id.

  **Root causes (2026-09-25, `fix/compaction-cost-telemetry-gaps`):**
  - *Ledger.* A cut is decided post-turn and waited in the session
    manager's in-memory queue for the next call on the *same* instance.
    Runtime logs for 81 cuts: 49 had a same-instance next turn (recorded);
    3 had an agent-cache miss and 18 resumed on a new microVM, both with
    an empty queue; 11 were never resumed. 32 lost is exactly the
    readout's 74 − 42. The cut now lands on the call that triggered it.
  - *`prefixTokens`.* Claude Sonnet 5 has no CountTokens, so every count
    is Strands' heuristic, which counts JSON at chars/2. The attribution
    hook treated any `BedrockModel` count as native. It now requires a
    native count, so Sonnet 5 rows read "not tracked".
  - *`contextBreakdown`.* It is not behind a flag. It was first written to
    `C#` rows on 2026-09-24, after the 1.24.0 release. Dev rows carry it.
    After release, only natively counted models will carry it.
  - *Session id.* Every `AgentCoreStack/Compaction` record from the
    session manager now carries `sessionId` as a property.

---

## 8. First full run (2026-09-25)

**Question.** Prod's summaries are AgentCore LTM records that `bound_summary`
compresses with Nova Micro, from a median of ~20k tokens to ~760 (§7.4). Does
the compacted context still answer what the full history answers?

**Configuration.**
- `records` mode with one record per turn and `--record-words 600`
  (`--chunk-turns 1`). That is ~20.7k tokens of records per transcript, and
  ~10.8k available at the cut.
- `cut --summary records --summary-model` with arms
  `full,model_relative,raw_summary`, on the restore pace with a 200k window.
- `ask --k 3 --workers 4` on `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`
  in dev.
- 12 transcripts × 9 plants, so 108 paired tasks per arm. 972 calls, all
  `end_turn`.

**Spend.** About $8.80 for `ask`: the cache was written once per history
and then read, and real tokens came to about 56% of the chars/4 estimate.
About $7 for two `records` passes; the first, at 8 turns per record, was too
small to trigger compression. Nova Micro cost is negligible. **About $16 in
total.**

**Compression reproduced.** `model_relative` compressed ~12.8k–15.9k tokens
of records to 381–2,629 (median ~730) in every transcript, against prod's
~20k → ~760. `raw_summary` carried ~14.7k uncompressed.

| family (n) | full | model_relative | raw_summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| constraint (36) | 1.00 | **0.72** (10 losses / 0 wins, p=0.002) | 1.00 |
| decision (24) | 1.00 | 0.79 (5 / 0, p=0.06) | 0.92 (2 / 0, p=0.5) |
| reference (24) | 0.96 | **0.58** (9 / 0, p=0.004) | 1.00 |
| superseded (24) | 0.96 | 0.92 (1 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.96 |

- **By retention.** Facts whose stating turn was cut scored 0.52
  (`model_relative`) against 0.96 (`raw_summary`). Facts whose turn was kept
  scored 0.96 and 0.98.
- **Free availability agreed before any model call.** The share of planted
  values anywhere in the context was constraint 72%, decision 79%, reference
  58% and superseded 96% under `model_relative`, and 100% across the board
  under `raw_summary`. For this corpus, the availability table was a near
  exact predictor of the scored result. Use it to screen changes for free
  before spending on `ask`.
- **Failure mode.** Almost every `model_relative` miss was `UNKNOWN`: 76 of
  81 wrong samples. The model knows it does not know, so the damage appears
  as "the assistant forgot what I told it", not as confident errors.

**Verdict.**
- **The model-relative cut is cleared.** The same cut with an uncompressed
  summary matches the full history.
- **The summary compression is vetoed** as a lossless step. It drops about
  28% of standing instructions and about 42% of exact identifiers.

**Levers, not yet chosen.** Rescore each with this harness before shipping.
1. **Compress less.**
   - Raise the floor of the compressed output. The prompt allows 4,400 words
     and Nova Micro returns about 550.
   - Or compress only above a much larger budget.
   - Cost check: carrying ~14.7k instead of ~0.7k adds ~14k tokens to the
     cached prefix. At 0.1× that is about $0.003 per turn on Sonnet 5
     Global, plus one 1.25× write at the cut. That is small next to a lost
     instruction, and quality wins per CLAUDE.md.
2. **A better compressor.** Haiku instead of Nova Micro, with the same
   budget. The records' own writer kept identifiers verbatim.
3. **Extract, then compress.** Pull standing instructions, decisions and
   identifiers verbatim into a pinned block, and let the model compress only
   the narrative.

**Caveats.**
- The records are Haiku-written stand-ins, not AgentCore's. Real records may
  already lose facts, so `raw_summary` is an upper bound.
- The corpus is synthetic. There is one answering model, and n=24–36 per
  family.
- The run covers only the restore pace. Warm sessions hold the full history
  up to the hard ceiling and are affected later, not less.

## 9. Screening the levers (2026-09-25, free check only)

**Method.** Same corpus, the same `records.json` as §8, and the restore pace.
Each candidate runs the production cut with only the summarizer swapped
(`compaction_quality/summarizers.py`, `Arm.summarizer`). Three repetitions
per candidate, because the compressors sample at `temperature` 0.1. Nova
Micro's own numbers moved between runs. The metric is free availability,
which is what the §8 paid run tracked family by family. Spend was pennies.

Share of planted values in context, as the mean of 3 runs (min–max), with
~108 plants per run:

| summarizer | all | constraint | decision | reference | superseded | summary tokens (median) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| prod: Nova Micro, `bound_summary` | 76.5 (74–79) | 77.8 | 76.4 | **58.3** | 93.1 | ~760 |
| option 3: extract + Nova Micro | 88.0 (87–89) | 84.3 | 90.3 | 84.7 | 94.4 | ~1,160 |
| option 2: Haiku 4.5, temperature only | 97.5 (96–99) | 99.1 | 100 | 90.3 | 100 | ~1,350 |
| option 2: **Nova 2 Lite**, prod `bound_summary` unchanged | 98.8 (98–100) | 100 | 95.8 | 100 | 98.6 | ~1,450 |
| option 3: extract + Haiku 4.5 | 100 (100–100) | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | ~1,870 |
| option 3: **extract + Nova 2 Lite** | **100 (100–100)** | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | ~1,900 |
| ceiling: uncompressed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | ~14,850 |

**⚠️ Found along the way: production cannot run Claude as the summarizer.**
`compress_with_model` sends both `temperature` and `topP`. Haiku 4.5
rejects that with "`temperature` and `top_p` cannot both be specified", so
setting `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MODEL_ID` to a Claude model
fails every compression, silently, into newest-first truncation. The first
screen measured exactly that: 69/63/58/92. The Haiku rows above use
`summarizers._compress`, which is the same prompt with `temperature` only.

**Cost per cut.** One cut compresses ~15–20k tokens of records. At
us-west-2 in-region rates from the Price List API, per MTok:
- Nova Micro: $0.035 / $0.14, about **$0.001** per cut;
- Nova 2 Lite: $0.33 / $2.75, about **$0.011** per cut, or ~$0.02 with
  extraction;
- Haiku 4.5: $1.10 / $5.50, about **$0.035**, or ~$0.06 with extraction.

At prod's ~18 cuts a day that is cents a day for any of them. The larger
summary also rides in the cached prefix: ~1.1k more tokens than today is
about $0.0002 per turn at a Sonnet 5 cache read. Neither cost is a reason
to keep the lossy compressor.

**Recommendation.**
1. **Nova 2 Lite as the summary model.** ✅ Shipped, and paid-confirmed in
   §9.1. It is a one-line default change
   (`Defaults.COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MODEL_ID = "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0"`)
   and runs on production's `bound_summary` unchanged, because Nova accepts
   `topP`. It lifts availability from 76.5% to 98.8%, and exact identifiers
   from 58% to 100%. The `us.*` profile works in dev, whose SCP denies
   `global.*`. The runtime role already allows every foundation model and
   profile.
2. **Then extract-then-compress**, moved from `summarizers.py` into
   `compaction_summary.py`, for the last ~1% and for robustness. Pinning
   facts verbatim is the structural fix for what compression drops. On Nova
   2 Lite it scored 100% in every run.
3. **Independently: drop `topP` from `compress_with_model`**, or send it
   only to models that accept it. It is a latent silent-failure trap for
   anyone who configures a Claude summarizer.
4. **Before shipping 1 or 2, confirm with a paid `ask`** on the chosen arm.
   Availability is an upper bound, though in §8 it tracked the scored result
   to within a few points per family.


### 9.1 Paid confirmation: Nova 2 Lite ships as the default (2026-09-25)

Recommendation 1 is shipped: `Defaults.COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MODEL_ID` is now
`us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`. Recommendation 4's paid `ask` ran on it before
merge.

**Configuration.** As in §8, with a fresh `records` pass (`--chunk-turns 1
--record-words 600`, 576 Haiku calls). Four arms:
- `full`: the control;
- `model_relative`: production defaults, so now Nova 2 Lite;
- `nova2lite_compress`: the same configuration again, pinned explicitly, as
  a second sample of a compressor that runs at `temperature` 0.1;
- `nova_micro_compress`: the old default, pinned, to keep the baseline
  visible in the same run.

Every compacted arm compressed through the model on all 12 cuts, from
12.4k–15.5k tokens of records. There was no fallback to truncation. Median
summary sizes were ~1,810 (`model_relative`), ~1,320 (`nova2lite_compress`)
and ~890 (`nova_micro_compress`) tokens.

| family (n) | full | model_relative (Nova 2 Lite) | nova2lite_compress | nova_micro_compress |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| constraint (36) | 1.00 | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.97 (1 / 0, p=1.0) | **0.83** (6 / 0, p=0.031) |
| decision (24) | 1.00 | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | **0.75** (6 / 0, p=0.031) |
| reference (24) | 0.96 | 1.00 (0 / 1, p=1.0) | 1.00 (0 / 1, p=1.0) | **0.62** (9 / 1, p=0.021) |
| superseded (24) | 0.96 | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.88 (2 / 0, p=0.5) |

Cells show accuracy, then losses / wins against `full`, then the exact
McNemar p.

- **By retention.** Facts whose stating turn was cut scored 1.00 and 0.98
  on the two Nova 2 Lite arms, against 0.56 on Nova Micro. Facts whose turn
  was kept scored 0.98 on all three arms.
- **Free availability again predicted the score.** Nova 2 Lite:
  100/100/100/100 and 97/100/100/100. Nova Micro: 83/75/62.5/96.
- **The one Nova 2 Lite constraint loss** is a value its summary dropped.
  It was absent from context, and the answer was `UNKNOWN`. That is the last
  ~1% that recommendation 2 (extract, then compress) is for.
- **Nova Micro reproduced §8's failure mode.** 71 of its 74 wrong samples
  were `UNKNOWN`.

**Verdict.** On this corpus, Nova 2 Lite compression is indistinguishable
from the full history in every family, with no significant loss. Nova Micro
loses significantly in three of four families. The §8 veto on the summary
compression is lifted for Nova 2 Lite.

**Spend.**
- `ask`: **$10.23** in real tokens, against the $16.34 chars/4 estimate
  (63%). The split was $4.58 for `full` and $1.79–$2.02 per compacted arm.
  1,296 calls, all `end_turn`.
- `records`: about $3.50.
- Nova 2 Lite compression: about $0.01 per cut.

**Still open.**
- Recommendation 2, extract then compress, for the last ~1%.
- Recommendation 3, `topP` for Claude summarizers, which is a separate task.
- The §8 caveats all still apply: Haiku-written stand-in records, a
  synthetic corpus, one answering model, and only the restore pace.

### 9.2 Paid confirmation: extract-then-compress in production code (2026-09-25)

This section is the first, **sequential** version, run before the Nova 2
Lite default landed, so `model_relative` here is Nova Micro. §9.3 supersedes
its latency and makes the calls concurrent.

Recommendation 2 moved into `compaction_summary.py`, behind
`COMPACTION_SUMMARY_EXTRACT_ENABLED` (in development, default off). The
harness's `extract_*` arms now set `summary_extract_enabled` on the config
and run the production `bound_summary`. They no longer swap in the
prototype copy in `summarizers.py`, which is deleted (`compress_only` stays).

**Configuration.** Same as §8 except the arms:
- fresh `records` (`--chunk-turns 1 --record-words 600`);
- `cut --summary records --summary-model` with arms
  `full,model_relative,extract_nova2lite` on the restore pace at 200k;
- `ask --k 3 --workers 4` on Haiku 4.5 in dev;
- 972 calls, all `end_turn`.

**Summaries.** Records came to ~12.2k–16.3k tokens at the cut.
`model_relative` (Nova Micro, plain) compressed them to 377–1,722 tokens.
`extract_nova2lite` returned `extract_then_compress` in all 12 sessions, at
702–3,865 tokens (median ~1,700).

| family (n) | full | model_relative | extract_nova2lite |
|---|---|---|---|
| constraint (36) | 1.00 | **0.78** (8 losses / 0 wins, p=0.008) | **1.00** (0 / 0, p=1.0) |
| decision (24) | 1.00 | **0.58** (10 / 0, p=0.002) | **1.00** (0 / 0, p=1.0) |
| reference (24) | 0.96 | **0.67** (8 / 1, p=0.039) | **1.00** (0 / 1, p=1.0) |
| superseded (24) | 0.96 | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) |

- **By retention.** Facts whose stating turn was cut scored **1.00** with
  extract-then-compress (n=52), against 0.50 with today's compression. Facts
  whose turn was kept scored 0.98 under both (n=56).
- **Free availability predicted it again.** It was 100% in every family for
  `extract_nova2lite`, and 77.8 / 58.3 / 70.8 / 100 for `model_relative`.
- **Misses.** `model_relative` had 82 wrong samples, 77 of them `UNKNOWN`.
  `extract_nova2lite` had 3.

**Spend.** About $7.20 for `ask` (actual tokens at Regional Haiku 4.5 rates,
against a $13.42 estimate). About $3.50 for `records`. About $11 in total.

**Latency of the sequential version, measured on these records** (4 cuts
each, dev, us-west-2). The summary step takes:
- Nova Micro plain: 3.3–7.3 s;
- Nova Micro extract: 4.2–10.2 s;
- Nova 2 Lite plain: 5.7–9.1 s;
- **Nova 2 Lite extract: 11.4–22.7 s.**

It runs in `update_after_turn`, after the turn's final `metadata` event and
before `done`, only on the turn that advances the checkpoint. So it adds
nothing before the first token, but on a cut turn it delays `done`, and with
it the release of the session's single-flight lease, by that much.

**Verdict.** Extract-then-compress on Nova 2 Lite, in production code, clears
the veto: no family loses to the full history. It relies on the Nova
2 Lite default (§9.1); on Nova Micro it screened at 88% (§9).

### 9.3 Concurrent calls, and a labelling fix (2026-09-25)

**Change.** The budget is now split up front:
- the pinned block gets at most half;
- the narrative gets the rest, less its joiner and header.

So the extraction and the narrative compression run side by side (`asyncio.gather`).
- An extraction failure now keeps the narrative as a plain compression
  (outcome `model`), instead of making a third call.
- A cut never makes more than two calls.
- The narrative's word limit roughly halves, to 2,198 at the default 8k
  budget. Nova 2 Lite's narratives mostly come in under that.

**Latency, per call, 12 cuts on the §9.2 records** (Nova 2 Lite, 8k budget):

| | median | max |
|---|---|---|
| extraction alone | 1.7 s | 9.7 s |
| narrative alone | 8.2 s | 15.4 s |
| **concurrent cut (what ships)** | **8.4 s** | **15.4 s** |
| the same two calls back to back | 11.6 s | 16.8 s |
| plain `bound_summary` (the default) | 7.6 s | 12.9 s |

The cut costs the narrative call; extraction finishes under it. So
extract-then-compress now costs about what the default does. The slow tail
is Nova 2 Lite's own output length, which swings from ~600 to ~3,500 tokens
on the same records.

**Rescore.**
- Free check, three reps on the §9.2 records: `extract_nova2lite` held
  **100%** in every family. Plain Nova 2 Lite (`model_relative`, now the
  default) held 97.2–100% constraint and 95.8% decision.
- Paid `ask` on the concurrent code, against the same `full` answers:

| family (n) | full | model_relative (Nova 2 Lite) | extract, concurrent |
|---|---|---|---|
| constraint (36) | 1.00 | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) |
| decision (24) | 1.00 | 0.96 (1 / 0, p=1.0) | 1.00 (0 / 0, p=1.0) |
| reference (24) | 0.96 | 1.00 (0 / 1, p=1.0) | 0.96 → **1.00** after the label fix (see below) |
| superseded (24) | 0.96 | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) | 0.96 (0 / 0, p=1.0) |

- **A labelling defect.** Before the fix, one reference fact came back
  `UNKNOWN` on all three samples although its value was in context. The
  extractor had copied `GJ-64861` verbatim but relabelled it
  "Budget reference". The question asked for "the budget workbook version
  tag", and the answering model could not connect the two.
  - Free availability cannot see this, because it only checks that the
    value is present. Only the paid `ask` can.
  - `IDENTIFIERS` now asks for each value "labelled with the conversation's
    own name for what it identifies".
  - Rescored with that prompt, `extract_nova2lite` answered every fact
    `full` does: constraint 1.00, decision 1.00, reference 1.00 (0 / 1),
    superseded 0.96. Facts whose stating turn was cut scored 1.00 (n=52).
  - **The fix itself is unproven.** In that run the pinned line still read
    "Budget reference"; the fact was answered because the narrative carried
    the label. Treat the prompt change as a reasonable instruction, not a
    measured one.
- **Narrative ceiling.** In 2 of 72 cuts the narrative hit its 4,000-token
  output cap. `compress_with_model` discards a `max_tokens` generation, so
  those cuts fell back to `extract_then_truncate`: the pinned block plus
  newest-first records. Availability stayed at 100% in both. The default
  single-call path has the same cap and the same discard (0 of 36 here);
  keeping a cut-off generation's complete lines is a separate fix for both.
- **Spend.** $8.28 for the first concurrent `ask`, and $1.85 for the rescore
  of the extract arm alone. The rescore reused the `full` answers, whose
  histories do not change.

**Verdict.** Concurrent extract-then-compress keeps the §9.2 result, with
no loss to the full history in any family, and brings the cut's latency to
the default's. Against plain Nova 2 Lite the paid run cannot separate the
two: both match `full` at this n. What extraction buys over the new default
is:
- facts pinned verbatim regardless of how the narrative is sampled
  (free availability 100% every rep against 96–100%);
- a pinned block that survives a failed narrative call.

### 9.4 Dev validation, and default on (2026-09-26)

**Forced cut on dev.** The deploy of the concurrent version had
`COMPACTION_SUMMARY_EXTRACT_ENABLED=true` on the Runtime. The session was a
throwaway on Haiku 4.5 (200k window, so a 100k ceiling):
- Its summary namespace was seeded with 30 harness records (≈12.2k tokens,
  five planted facts).
- Filler turns pushed it to 104,911 input tokens.

- **The cut.**
  - Outcome `extract_then_compress`, 12,181 → 3,394 tokens, parked as
    pending.
  - All five planted facts were in the pinned block, verbatim and labelled.
- **Calls.** Bedrock showed exactly two Nova 2 Lite invocations that minute,
  the extraction and the narrative in parallel. They took 19,566 input and
  2,832 output tokens, about $0.014. The slower call ran 14.3 s, so that
  turn took 18 s against 2.6 s for the model's answer.
- **Apply.** After a 339 s gap the cut applied on a cache-expired turn
  (`miss_ttl_expired`, so the re-write was free). Haiku answered all five
  facts from the summary alone.
- **Byte stability.** The next turn read the new prefix from cache (`hit`),
  so the pinned summary restores byte for byte.
- **Noise.** The extractor listed 30 bare "Section identifier: N" lines, a
  few hundred tokens that carry nothing a user would ask about. Tightening
  `IDENTIFIERS` needs its own paid rescore, because the label defect in §9.3
  was only visible to `ask`.

**Default on.** `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_EXTRACT_ENABLED` now defaults on, with
`=false` as the kill switch.
- The CDK entry and the `platform.yml` variable are gone. A default-on flag
  needs no AgentCore Runtime env var slot, which takes the Runtime back to
  48 of 50.
- Setting the kill switch in a deployed environment is now an out-of-band
  Runtime update.
- In the harness, `model_relative` follows the production default and
  extracts. `nova2lite_compress` and `nova_micro_compress` pin
  `summary_extract_enabled=False` as the plain-compression baselines.
