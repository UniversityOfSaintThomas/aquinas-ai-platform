        Adds ``ask_user_question``'s guidance when that tool is in the turn's
        effective tool list. Without it the model overwhelmingly answers an
        ambiguous request in prose instead of asking (measured 4/24 vs 24/24);
        see ``SYSTEM_PROMPT_GUIDANCE`` for why the text is load-bearing.

        Three deliberate choices:

        * **Gated on the tool, not shipped to everyone.** A user without the
          tool would otherwise carry an instruction to call something they do
          not have.
        * **Keyed on the POST-FILTER list**, not the request's
          ``enabled_tools``. The two diverge — a tool id the catalog knows but
          the registry does not is dropped by ``ToolFilter`` with a log line
          (``canvas_faculty`` does this today) — and keying on the request
          would advertise a tool absent from ``toolConfig``. It also picks up
          the ``ASK_USER_QUESTION_ENABLED`` kill switch for free: while off the
          tool is never registered, so it cannot appear here.
        * **Applied to the prompt handed to the agent, not to
          ``self.system_prompt``.** That field is snapshotted for resume and
          hashed into the agent cache key; this text is derived from
          ``enabled_tools``, which the cache key already covers via
          ``tools_hash``, so mutating it would change resume's cache slot for
          no benefit. ``PrefixFingerprintHook`` reads the prompt off the built
          agent, so ``systemPromptHash`` still reflects what was really sent.

        Cost: ~70 tokens, constant per configuration, inside the cacheable
        prefix — it is written once per session, never re-written per turn.

                including diverted ones, for the `[Attached files: …]` marker

            turn_project_id: The Shared Project whose harness ran this turn, if
                any; recorded on each cost row and in the project's monthly rollup.
                Per turn for the same reason as `turn_agent_id`.

                as the mid-turn steering inbox. Passed per turn rather than read
                off the agent for the same reason as `turn_agent_id`: the agent
