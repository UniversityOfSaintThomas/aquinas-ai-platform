    When ``OAuthConsentHook`` (or the tool-approval hook) calls
    ``event.interrupt(...)``, Strands sets ``_interrupt_state.activated`` and
    stops. If the user never completes consent and instead just types a new
    message, that flag is still set on the cached agent — and
    ``InterruptState.resume`` rejects a plain string prompt with
    ``TypeError: prompt_type=<class 'str'> | must resume from interrupt with
    list of interruptResponse's``. It reached the user as a non-recoverable
    ``stream_error``: the session was stuck, because every subsequent fresh
    turn hit the same flag.

    The "a fresh turn supersedes a paused turn" policy already exists — see
    ``clear_paused_turn`` / ``clear_interrupted_turn`` in
    ``inference_api/chat/routes.py``. Those only clear the DynamoDB side; the
    live object on the cached agent was missed. Same sticky-state-on-a-cached-
    agent family as the cancel flags above.

    Deactivating is not enough on its own. Strands appends the assistant
    ``toolUse`` message to ``agent.messages`` *before* running tools
    (``event_loop.py``), and on interrupt it returns without ever appending
    the matching ``toolResult`` — so history ends on an unanswered tool call.
    ``_repair_tool_pairing`` can't help here: it deliberately leaves a
    *trailing* toolUse alone ("left for prompt-arrival handling") and doesn't
    even count it as a violation, so at this point in the turn it no-ops. Left
    as-is, Strands appends the new user message behind the dangling toolUse
    and Bedrock rejects the request.

    So we drop the abandoned turn back to the last completed assistant turn.
    That clears the unanswered toolUse *and* leaves the history ending on an
    assistant message, so the incoming user prompt keeps roles alternating.
    Synthesizing an error ``toolResult`` instead would satisfy the pairing
    rule but leave two consecutive user turns (the synthetic result, then the
    real prompt), which Bedrock rejects just the same.

    Dropping messages rewrites the prompt-cache prefix, so this costs a cache
    write — on a turn the user has already abandoned, which is the right place
    to spend it. Nothing is lost from the *conversation*: the abandoned turn
    produced no assistant answer, and the transcript the user sees is
    persisted separately.

        ``reason`` records why: the default ``connection_lost`` is the
        disconnect backstop (conditional, never downgrades a stronger
        ``user_stopped`` the client beacon may have written); the cooperative
        Stop arm passes ``user_stopped`` so the marker is correct even if that
        beacon never landed.

        Runs from inside the ``except (CancelledError, GeneratorExit)`` arm,
        i.e. while the request task is being torn down. Any bare ``await``
        here would itself be cancelled before it completes, so the work is
        wrapped in ``asyncio.shield`` around an independent task — the writes
        finish even as the outer stream unwinds. Best-effort throughout: a
        failure logs and never masks the original teardown exception (the
        caller re-raises it).

        Only the assistant partial is persisted — the user turn (and any
        mid-turn message that completed before the interruption) was already
        committed by Strands' MessageAddedEvent/append_message hook (same
        reasoning as the error paths; canonical reference in
        ``session/persistence.py``).

        Role-alternation repair: a synthetic assistant turn is persisted only
        when it keeps user/assistant alternation valid — i.e. the last
        committed message is NOT itself an assistant turn. This covers two
        cases at once:
          * empty partial + dangling user tail → persist a minimal placeholder
            so the orphan user turn is answered (the user→user repair);
          * non-empty partial + assistant tail (an interrupted continuation/
            resume, where the tail is the message being extended) → SKIP, so we
            don't append a second consecutive assistant turn and brick the
            session. The partial stays a live-only affordance for that turn.
        Whenever nothing is persisted, only the marker is set. The write itself
        also passes ``last_persisted_role`` to ``persist_synthetic_messages`` so
        the centralized alternation guard is the single enforcement point.

        interrupt Strands routes through ``_stop_for_interrupts``, so the
        ``PausedTurnSnapshot`` written on this same ``done`` event covers it.

        Two things are specific to this flavor:

        * **The conversation id is added here, not in the tool.** The tool
          knows only which *browser* session it handed over;
          ``sessionId`` on the event means the conversation, as it does on
          every other SSE event, and this is the layer that has it.
        * **The D4 projection is written here too**, for the same reason: the
          write is keyed by conversation and owner, which the tool does not
          know. It is best-effort — without it the prompt still renders and
          the turn still resumes on skip; the user just has no working viewer.

        PR #3 of the MCP Apps host-renderer initiative
        (`docs/kaizen/scoping/mcp-apps-host-renderer.md`), generalised so the
        frame can mount EARLY. When the host flag is on and the tool declared
        a `ui://` resource in its `tools/list` `_meta.ui` (recorded in the
        catalog by PR #2), fetch that resource via the spec-mandated
        `resources/read` against the same MCP client that surfaced the tool,
        and emit a single

            `{type, toolUseId, resourceUri, html, mimeType, csp, permissions}`

        event with the HTML inlined (so the frontend needs no MCP client). The
        blocking `resources/read` runs in a worker thread so the live stream
        is not stalled.

        Two call sites share this via the `emitted` dedupe set: the early
        mount at a UI tool's `content_block_start` (so the App's bridge is
        live *before* arguments stream — the window the `ui_tool_input_partial`
        stream needs) and the legacy post-`tool_result` fallback (covers a
        tool whose name wasn't captured at block start). The resource shell is
        static per `resourceUri` — independent of the tool's args/result — so
        fetching it at block start yields the same payload as at result time.

        WHAT THIS FIXES
        ---------------
        ``_drain_agent_status_events`` is called from the coordinator's emit
        loop, which only regains control when the agent stream yields. During
        tool execution the agent stream yields NOTHING, so a ``tool_start`` sat
        in the hook's queue for exactly the silence it existed to explain and
        arrived bundled with its own ``tool_end``. Measured on a three-tool
        browse turn: the indicator read "Thinking" for all 4.5s and never named
        a tool. The SPA worked around it by deriving the running tool from the
        content stream instead — correct, but it leaves every OTHER phase
        (model call, batch shape) unreachable.

        HOW
        ---
        Race the agent stream's next event against a short timer. On a timeout,
        drain the hook and yield whatever it recorded; on an event, drain first
        (so a status still precedes the event it describes, exactly as before)
        and then yield the event.

        The in-flight ``__anext__`` is deliberately kept across timeouts rather
        than re-requested: an async generator cannot have two ``__anext__``
        calls outstanding, and re-creating it would drop events.

        ON EARLY EXIT
        -------------
        The coordinator abandons this stream on several paths (cooperative
        stop, max_tokens, a conversational error). Closing an async generator
        runs the ``finally`` below, which cancels the in-flight ``__anext__``.
        That throws ``CancelledError`` into ``process_agent_stream`` at its
        yield point and unwinds it — the cleanup-on-cancellation path that
        generator already documents and already took when the coordinator
        consumed it directly.

        ONE CONTEXT FOR EVERY STEP
        --------------------------
        Each ``__anext__`` runs as its own task, and a task runs in a *copy* of
        the context it was created from. Strands holds its spans open across
        yields (``use_span`` around the whole invocation, each cycle, each model
        stream), so a span attached in one step and detached in a later one
        tried to reset an OpenTelemetry token in a context that never saw it:
        ``Failed to detach context`` on every such exit (~5 per tool turn), and
        every span opened from the ambient context in between — the Memory
        ``CreateEvent`` calls, DynamoDB reads from hooks — parented to the
        request span instead of the cycle that caused it. Running every step in
        one ``Context`` restores what a plain ``async for`` gave the generator:
        one context that persists across its yields.

        Best-effort in both directions: with no hook (voice, tests) or a failing
        drain this degrades to a plain pass-through of the agent stream.
