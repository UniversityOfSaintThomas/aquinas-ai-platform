Bounded compaction summary.

Spec: docs/specs/compaction-model-relative-thresholds.md §3.6 and
docs/specs/compaction-over-threshold-cache-spiral.md PR-2 (defect D2).

The compaction summary used to be an unbounded join of AgentCore Long-Term
Memory ``ConversationSummary`` records — a log that grows for the life of the
session (164,991 chars ≈ 40k tokens in the incident). A summary that is 40%
of the threshold guarantees compaction can never get back under it. This
module holds the persisted summary at or under a token budget:

1. **Within budget** → unchanged.
2. **Over budget** → one call to the summary model (Nova 2 Lite, the same
   side-channel pattern as titles and tool-batch summaries) that compresses
   the records into a bounded, instruction-preserving summary. It runs once,
   at checkpoint advance — the turn that already pays a prefix re-write.
3. **Model unavailable / failed / still over budget** → newest-first
   truncation of the records: keep the most recent records that fit, and if
   even the newest alone does not fit, keep its tail. Never oldest-first —
   recent context is what the model needs.

**Extract-then-compress** (``extract_enabled``, in development, default off).
Compression alone drops the facts a conversation cannot lose: on the quality
harness Nova Micro kept constraints at 0.72 and identifiers at 0.58 of the
uncompacted control. With the flag on, step 2 becomes two calls:

a. An **extraction** call copies standing instructions, decisions,
   identifiers and changed values (latest value only) verbatim into a pinned
   block, capped at half the budget.
b. **Concurrently**, the narrative is compressed, with the prompt above,
   into the other half.

The persisted text is ``PINNED FACTS …`` followed by ``SUMMARY: …``. The two
calls run side by side, so the cut costs the slower one, not the sum. If
extraction fails the narrative alone is the summary (a plain compression);
if the narrative fails the pinned block is kept and the records are truncated
into the rest; if both fail, the records are truncated. Never a third call.
The model matters: the harness screen kept 100% of planted facts on Nova 2
Lite and Haiku 4.5, and 88% on Nova Micro (docs/kaizen/scoping/
2026-09-21-quality-veto-harness.md §9).

A generation that hits its output ceiling is **salvaged**, not discarded:
its complete lines are kept, trimmed from the end to the budget. The prompt
orders the summary by value (standing instructions first), so a head cut
short still beats newest-first truncation of the raw records, which drops
the oldest instructions first. Nova 2 Lite's narrative length varies several
times over on the same records, so the ceiling is hit in normal use.

Whatever comes out is persisted verbatim in ``CompactionState.summary`` and
prepended byte-identically at every restore, so the byte-stability contract
is unchanged: the summary still only mutates at checkpoint advance.

2. Decisions made and their reasons.

5. Exact identifiers: file names, URLs, course or project names, IDs, numbers, dates, names of people.

Drop: greetings, pleasantries, superseded drafts and revisions, step-by-step narration of tool calls, and anything already covered by a later note.

- Plain text with short headings or bullets. No preamble, no closing remark.
