"""Context-bound tools for an Agent's bound Memory Space (Agent Designer Phase 3).

Each factory closes over the *binding's* space id and the *invoking* user's identity, so
the returned tool can physically only address that one space as that one user — it cannot
be re-pointed at another space. ``MemorySpaceService`` re-checks the caller's grant
(``viewer+`` for reads, ``editor+`` for writes) on every call, so a permission revoked
mid-session surfaces as an error tool-result on the next call rather than leaking access.
Same closure-identity + ``asyncio.to_thread`` pattern as the artifact/spreadsheet tools
(the codebase has no tool-execution contextvar; ``MemorySpaceService`` is sync boto3).

These are injected via the invocation path's ``extra_tools`` seam only when an Agent has a
resolved ``memory_space`` binding. Since Shared Projects 2.1 such an agent may be cached:
the cache key carries the invoking user's id and a digest of the binding (space id, name,
access), which is everything these closures hold, so a tool closed over user A's identity
can never be served to user B.

A project's harness never gets these; it gets the scope-addressed family in
:mod:`.project_tools` (2.4b). Their specs stay byte-identical, because they are part of
every memory-bound Agent's prompt-cached ``toolConfig``.
