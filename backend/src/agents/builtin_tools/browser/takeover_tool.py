"""`request_user_login` — hand the browser to the user so they can sign in.

The agent hits a login wall, calls this, and the turn pauses. The user drives
the real browser through a live view, signs in with their own hands, and hands
it back; the turn resumes with the session authenticated and the agent carries
on browsing. See `docs/specs/authenticated-web-assessment.md`.

Why this is its own tool, not a `browse_web` action
---------------------------------------------------
RBAC granularity in this codebase is exactly one `tool_id`: a role's
`grantedTools` holds catalog keys, those roll up through parents in
`_compute_effective_permissions`, and the result becomes `enabled_tool_ids`
for `ToolFilter`. There is no sub-tool gate. An *action* on `browse_web` would
therefore ship an interactive browser inside our AWS account to everyone who
can browse, students included. As a separate catalog entry it is granted on its
own, and a user without the grant never has it registered — so it never reaches
`toolConfig`, the model cannot offer it, and that user pays zero prefix tokens
for it (spec D1).

Why an interrupt rather than a new endpoint
-------------------------------------------
The turn genuinely must stop: the agent has nothing to do until a human
finishes, and a turn that polls for login completion burns model calls to learn
nothing. `ask_user_question` already proved the pause/snapshot/resume path, and
Strands routes tool-raised and hook-raised interrupts through the same
`_stop_for_interrupts`, so the `PausedTurnSnapshot`, the resume route and the
breadcrumb need no special case (spec D1b).

⚠️ **Strands re-executes an interrupted tool from the top on resume**
(`strands/types/interrupt.py`), so everything above the `interrupt()` call runs
twice. Two separate things keep that safe, and they are not interchangeable:
`session_pool.take_control` is idempotent, which prevents a second
`UpdateBrowserStream` flip; the takeover marker on `agent.state` preserves the
*descriptor* — the original deadline above all — so the resume is judged
against the window the user was actually given rather than a fresh one minted
on the way back in. The marker also keeps a resume that lands in a container
which has lost the session from calling `acquire` and silently starting a
second, unauthenticated browser.

Credentials
-----------
Nothing here accepts a secret, and nothing should be added that does. The
entire point is that the password is typed into a real browser by the person it
belongs to — a credential passed as a tool argument would land in the prompt,
in AgentCore Memory and in the cacheable prefix, and be re-read on every
subsequent turn for the life of the conversation.

Cost
----
The tool spec is a constant in `toolConfig` for granted users (~200 tokens,
paid once per cache write). A complete login round trip adds one short line to
the conversation: the live view is a video stream the model never sees, the
login page and the user's keystrokes never enter the prompt, and no URL travels
anywhere near the model (spec D2).

    Use this when `browse_web` has reached a page that requires authentication
    — a sign-in form, a paywall, an SSO redirect, an institutional subscription
    wall — and the content behind it is what the task needs. The user takes
    control of the same browser you are driving, signs in themselves, and hands
    it back; your next `browse_web` call continues on the authenticated page.

    Never ask the user for a username, password, one-time code or any other
    credential in your reply, and never type one into a page yourself. You
    cannot be given credentials and you do not need them: that is what this
    tool is for.

    Navigate to the page that needs the sign-in *before* calling this, so the
    user arrives where they expect to be rather than on a blank tab.

    Call it once per sign-in. If the user declines or the window lapses, say
    what you could not reach and carry on with what is public — do not ask
    again in the same turn.

    Args:
