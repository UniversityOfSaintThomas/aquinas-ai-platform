"""Browser session lifecycle, keyed per conversation.

One AgentCore Browser session is reused across the tool calls of a
conversation: starting a session costs seconds and dollars, and a browsing
task is inherently multi-step.

Where the key lives matters. Per the "one session can be served by more than
one agent" rule in CLAUDE.md, nothing durable may be cached on an agent
instance — so the *identity* of the browser session (its id) is stored on the
Strands `agent.state`, exactly as `app_context_dispatch` stores app context,
while the live socket is a process-local lookup keyed by that id. A second
agent instance for the same conversation reads the same id from state; if the
socket isn't in this process it reconnects to the same remote session rather
than starting a second one.

`AgentState.get()` deep-copies, so the bag is read-modify-written wholesale
and every value is JSON-serializable.

    The intent was a MANAGED policy — mandated and un-overridable — so that a
    human holding the browser during a takeover could not navigate to the LMS
    and have an agent act as them. That requires `CreateBrowser`, because the
    service refuses MANAGED at session level (see `_SESSION_POLICY_TYPE`).

    * It constrains the **agent**, which drives through CDP and never opens
      Chromium's settings, so the blocklist holds for ordinary `browse_web`.
    * It does **not** constrain a **human** in a takeover, who has a fully
      interactive browser and can override a recommended policy.

    So `request_user_login` must stay ungranted until the MANAGED policy is
    applied at `CreateBrowser`. The RBAC grant and `BROWSER_TAKEOVER_ENABLED`
