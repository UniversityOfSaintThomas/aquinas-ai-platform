"""``document_read`` — page-range and pattern retrieval over the session's documents.

The recovery half of ``docs/specs/document-context-offload.md`` (§4B). A
document the user attached lives in the model's context only until history
is restored (restore strips inline bytes; see
``TurnBasedSessionManager._strip_document_bytes``) or, later, until the
offload trigger swaps it for a digest. This tool is how the model gets the
part it needs back — a PDF page range as a native ``document`` block (full
fidelity: text layer plus page images), a regex over the text layer to find
the right pages, or bounded text for text-family documents.

Design notes
------------
* **Gated on session state, not on the tool picker.** The tool is built for
  any session that has a readable document (``_build_document_tools`` in
  ``apis/inference_api/chat/routes.py``), whatever the user's RBAC grants.
  The ``workspace_files`` catalog key is granted to no prod role, so gating
  there would ship the recovery path dark. Its id therefore stays OUT of
  ``INJECTED_TOOL_IDS`` — same reasoning as the Memory-Space tools: the
  governing capability is the user's own attachment.
* Identity is captured by closure (``make_document_read_tool``), never read
  from ``invocation_state``.
* One call can never re-inject a whole document: page ranges are capped by
  ``max_pages`` (default 8, hard cap 20), pattern results by match count,
  text by the workspace read bound.
* A pattern scan is bounded in *time* as well as in output. The regex is
  model-supplied, and a nested-quantifier pattern makes Python's backtracking
  engine run exponentially — measured at 14 s for a 28-character line, against
  extracted PDF lines of 60–100 — with no way to cancel a running
  ``re.search``. ``catastrophic_pattern`` refuses that family up front (the
  pattern is searched literally, and the payload says so) and
  ``DOCUMENT_READ_PATTERN_BUDGET_SECONDS`` bounds the walk for anything it
  does not catch.
* **Content-free record per call** in ``AgentCoreStack/Compaction``
  (``DocumentRead``, ``DocumentReadPages``, ``DocumentReadBytes``; properties
  ``mode`` / ``format``) — the same namespace as the compaction cut and
  tool-result offload records, so one dashboard explains what bounded a
  session's prefix. Nothing from the document is ever emitted.
* Tool results carrying a native ``document`` block are exempt from the
  tool-result offloader (``core/tool_result_offload.py``): offloading the
  slice the model just asked for would defeat the read.

        Use this when a document you need is no longer inline (its content
        was replaced by a placeholder or digest after the conversation was
        restored) or when you need specific pages of a long document.

        Modes, by argument:
        - No arguments: list this conversation's readable documents with
          their upload_id, format and size.
        - upload_id + page_range (PDF only, e.g. "4-7"): returns those pages
          as an attached document at full fidelity (text and page images),
          at most max_pages per call. The attachment's own page k is
          original page start+k-1 — cite original page numbers.
        - upload_id + pattern: case-insensitive regex over the text; returns
          matching lines with page numbers (PDF) or line/paragraph numbers
          (text, Word), so you can then read the right pages. Use this first
          on a long document instead of paging through it.
        - upload_id alone: for a PDF, the page count and a per-page snippet
          index; for text and Word documents, the text itself (bounded —
          continue with offset = next_offset when truncated).

        Prefer pattern then a narrow page_range over reading many pages.
        Spreadsheets are read with analyze_spreadsheet and presentations
        with read_powerpoint_presentation, not here.

        Args:
            upload_id: The document's id (from the listing, the attachment
                note, or an earlier call). Empty to list documents.
            page_range: 1-indexed inclusive page range for PDFs, "start-end"
                or a single page "5".
            pattern: Regular expression (case-insensitive) to search for.
                Do not nest one unbounded quantifier inside another — write
                "X+" rather than "(X+)+" — because such a pattern can take
                exponential time; it is searched as literal text instead and
                the result says so.
            max_pages: Cap on pages returned by page_range (default 8, hard
                cap 20).
            offset: Byte offset to continue a truncated text read.

        Returns:
            JSON metadata, plus the requested pages as an attached document
            for page_range reads.
