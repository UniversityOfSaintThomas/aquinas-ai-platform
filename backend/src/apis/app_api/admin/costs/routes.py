    Get the per-model-call "cost anatomy" of a session.

    partial_miss | miss_ttl_expired | miss_avoidable | uncached), and the
    prompt-cache prefix fingerprint hashes (toolConfig / system prompt /
    history) — plus session-level rollups (cache efficiency, avoidable-miss
    and partial-miss counts, wastedUsd).

    This is the forensic view for diagnosing avoidable prompt-cache
    re-writes: on a miss_avoidable row, diff its fingerprint hashes against
    the previous row's to see which prefix component changed.

    ⚠️ **A `partial_miss` row costs like a miss even though it read from
    cache.** It means a leading segment (typically tools + system) hit while
    the rest of the prefix was re-written against a live entry — the shape
    that spent 90% of one user's monthly quota while every row read `hit`.
    Its dollars are in `wastedUsd`; `partialMissUsd` / `partialMissCount`
    name the subset.

    ⚠️ **Check `agentSwitched` before treating a miss as a regression.** An
    `@`-mention hands one turn to a different Agent, which genuinely re-writes
    the prefix — it presents exactly like the nondeterministic-ordering bug the
    fingerprints exist to catch (`toolConfigHash` and `systemPromptHash` flipping
    together), so the row says which it was, and `turnAgentId` says which Agent
    ran it. The session rollup splits the same way: `agentSwitchMissCount` /
    `agentSwitchUsd` are a *subset* of `avoidableMissCount` / `wastedUsd`, never
    deducted from them. Subtract to get unexplained waste — that difference is
    what a prefix-stability regression moves.
