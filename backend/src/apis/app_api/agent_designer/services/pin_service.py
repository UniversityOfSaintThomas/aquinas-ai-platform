"""Agent Marketplace Phases 5-6 — the pin read and write (D8, D9).

"Add to my agents" stores a pointer (D8). This module turns that pointer list back into
something renderable, which is the whole of the work: the stored state is ids, and a shelf
needs icon, name, tagline and publisher.

Three rules are load-bearing:

**1. The pin list is access-checked on every read.** A pin is a bookmark, not a grant.
``get_assistant_with_access_check`` is the same gate the detail page uses, so an Agent
that goes ``PUBLIC`` → ``PRIVATE`` disappears from every stranger's Pinned tab at once,
and nothing here can hand a user a row they could not have reached by navigating. Denied
rows are dropped from the *response*, never from the stored pin: visibility is reversible,
and deleting someone's pin because an author toggled a setting for an afternoon would be a
silent, unrecoverable edit to their shelf.

**2. A pin survives a takedown.** D2 is explicit that delisting is not revocation —
existing pins keep working and conversations underway keep running. So the projection here
tolerates an Agent with no ``listing`` block at all, unlike the browse read, whose whole
safety property is that it can only see published rows.

**3. One read per pin, through the access check, rather than a batch read plus a second
access path.** ``get_assistant_with_access_check`` already fetches the record, so batching
the fetch would mean either re-reading each Agent anyway or restating the visibility rules
here — a second copy of an access decision, which is how a resource ends up *listed* by one
path and *denied* by another (the ``can_access_model`` divergence in CLAUDE.md's RBAC
rule). A pin list is bounded by ``MAX_PINS`` and is normally a handful of ids; a duplicated
access rule is unbounded in cost.

**4. Role-seeded pins are resolved live, per request (D9.1, Phase 6).** The effective list
is *(⋃ role pins for the roles the caller matched) − dismissed(unlocked only) ∪ own pins*.
Nothing is materialized per member, so removing a role pin removes it for everyone who had
not independently pinned the Agent — and a user who *did* pin it has converted the seed to
their own pin, which survives. The role ids come from ``resolve_user_permissions``, whose
``app_roles`` is the list of roles that actually matched (including the ``default``
substitution); the pins themselves are read by their own query, never from
``EffectivePermissions``.
