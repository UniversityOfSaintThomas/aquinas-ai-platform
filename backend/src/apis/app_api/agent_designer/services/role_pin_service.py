"""Agent Marketplace Phase 6 — the admin side of default pins (D9, D10).

Projects a role's stored pin ids into rows an admin can read, and answers the question
D9.5 asks before a save: **will this Agent actually work for this role's members?**

Two checks, deliberately separate, because they fail for different reasons and have
different remedies:

* **Reachability** — a ``PRIVATE`` Agent is visible to its owner alone and a ``SHARED``
  one to its share list, so seeding either to a role hands most members a pin that
  silently resolves to nothing (``list_pins`` access-checks every row on every read). The
  remedy is the *author's*: publish it, or set it PUBLIC. This is not gated on the listing
  being *published* — an Agent can be PUBLIC without ever having been submitted to the
  store, and a role seed is a pin, not a shelf slot.

* **Runnability against the role** — the Agent's pinned model and its tool/skill bindings
  diffed against that role's own ``effective_permissions``, which
  ``_compute_effective_permissions`` already denormalizes onto the AppRole record. Seeding
  410 researchers an Agent that fails on their first message is the exact failure D9.5
  exists to prevent. The remedy is the *admin's*: grant the capability, or seed something
  else.

Both **warn**; neither refuses. An admin can legitimately seed an Agent whose author is
about to publish it, or whose missing tool is about to be granted, and a save that blocks
on a condition the admin is mid-way through fixing teaches people to work around the
console rather than through it.

⚠️ The role-level diff is narrower than the per-user one on purpose. ``memory_space``
resolves per person and cannot be decided for a role at all, so it is reported as a *note*
rather than counted as present or missing — "ready" here must never claim to have checked
something it could not.
