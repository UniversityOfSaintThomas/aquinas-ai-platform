"""Agent Marketplace Phase 3 — the detail read and the runnability preview (D4, D6).

Two reads over one Agent record, with one thing in common: **they speak in names.**

* ``resolve_capabilities`` answers *what does this Agent reach?* — the bound primitives
  projected to ``{label, kind}``. Labels come from the **unfiltered** catalog, on
  purpose: D6 has to be able to name a capability the viewer lacks, and a viewer-filtered
  lookup would silently drop exactly the entries that matter most.
* ``resolve_runnability`` answers *will it run for me?* — the Agent's ``modelConfig`` +
  ``bindings`` diffed against the viewer's own ``bindable_catalog.list_bindable``
  results. It **composes the five existing per-primitive access services** and adds no
  sixth (Agent Designer D4); every ``list_bindable`` call here is the same call the
  Designer's picker makes, so "what you may bind" and "what will run for you" can never
  drift apart.

Two rules in here are load-bearing and easy to erode:

**1. ``knowledge_base`` is never gated.** ``compat.effective_bindings`` synthesizes a
``knowledge_base`` binding on *every* legacy Agent, while ``list_bindable`` returns an
empty list for that kind (the KB is welded to the Agent and is not user-configurable).
A naive diff therefore marks every legacy Agent *blocked*. The KB is excluded from both
reads instead — it is not a capability the viewer can lack.

**2. There are two states, not three.** ``agent_binding_resolver`` is block-with-message
for *every* kind it resolves — a missing model, tool, skill or memory space raises rather
than degrading — which is the Designer spec's D5 rule: "No **downgrade** on missing
capability (block-only v1)". The Marketplace spec's D6 originally sketched a middle
``limits`` state, gated on a binding declaring ``config.optional``; nothing ever wrote
that flag, so it was unreachable, and building toward it would have contradicted D5. A
preview offering an outcome the runtime cannot produce is a preview that lies. Removed in
 #747. If downgrade is ever taken up as an opt-in, it starts at the resolver, not here.
