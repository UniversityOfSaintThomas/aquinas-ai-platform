"""Agent Marketplace Phase 1 — submit / review / takedown orchestration (D2, D7, D12, D13).

Where the authorization, the disclosure checks and the state machine meet. The machine
itself is pure (``apis.shared.assistants.listing``) and the writes are isolated
(``apis.shared.assistants.listing_repository``); this module decides *whether* a given
caller may walk a given edge, and what has to be true first.

Three rules are enforced here and nowhere else:

* **Submission is the disclosure point (D7).** Publishing an Agent effectively publishes
  the contents of every skill its author wrote and bound, because Skills v2 resolves a
  ``skill`` binding on ``skill.owner_id == agent.owner_id``. The author is shown that list
  before a reviewer's time is spent, and a ``memory_space`` binding blocks submission
  outright — a memory space is personal data that re-resolution will deny to every other
  viewer, so a published agent bound to one is a guaranteed failure for everyone.
* **Approval is the only door into the store (D2).** ``in_review → published`` is the sole
  edge that writes a directory key, and only ``require_admin`` routes reach it.
* **Admins own presentation, authors own behavior (D13).** The patch path can reach
  ``name``/``tagline``/``iconKey``/``category``/``publisherId`` and nothing else, and every
  such edit is recorded on the listing so the author is told rather than surprised.

⚠️ ``publisherId`` appears nowhere in an access decision in this file. Ownership
(``resolve_assistant_permission``) is what gates the author paths; ``require_admin`` gates
the rest. Publisher is a name on a shelf.

    **The same endpoint, three different acts, and the listing decides which.** Before
    publication, withdrawing is the author's alone: a pending submission is their own work
    and pulling it costs nobody anything. Once a listing is live, other people have pinned
    it, so removal becomes something an admin sees — the same reasoning that makes
    publication go through a queue in the first place (D2). Splitting these across two
    endpoints was the alternative and is worse: the author's intent is identical either way
    ("take this down"), and making them pick the right verb for their listing's state is
    asking them to know the state machine.

    The third act is the one that is easy to miss. An author with a live listing who submits
    an **update** and then changes their mind is not asking for anything to come down — they
    want their edit back. Read by "is something on the shelf?" alone, that cancellation turns
    into a request to delist a listing nobody asked to delist, parked in an admin's queue. So
    a pending update cancels back to the state it was submitted from and the listing carries
    on serving the version it always was; see ``author_cancel_target``.

    No act here revokes anything retroactively: people who pinned it keep their pin,
    conversations underway keep running, and the agent stays reachable by direct link
    because ``visibility`` is a separate axis. It is a delisting, not a recall.

    ``taken_down`` resolves to the immediate branch, and that is the point of the

    request. Before the edge existed this raised, and an author who simply wanted to delete a
