"""Agent Designer Phase 1 — design-time binding + model validation (D4/D5).

Composes the *existing* per-primitive access checks; invents no new RBAC (D4). Run at
write time against the **author** (design-time half of D5); Phase 3 re-resolves each
binding against the invoking user at run time.

Resolution scope:
- ``model``          → must exist + author passes ``ModelAccessService.can_access_model``.
- ``tool``           → author must have the tool in the ``/agents/bindable`` palette
  (``ToolCatalogService.get_user_accessible_tools``, the SAME source the picker fetches, so
  "if the palette offers it, the write accepts it" — cf. the model check). A ref may be
  *scoped* (``toolId::mcpToolName``) to bind a subset of an MCP server's tools: the base
  id is checked against the palette and the tool name against that server's discovered
  ``serverTools`` list. Run-time then re-resolves each bound tool against the *invoker*
  (``AppRoleService.can_access_tool``, D5).
- ``skill``          → feature-flagged; author must have the skill in the ``/agents/bindable``
  palette (``resolve_accessible_skill_ids``, the SAME source the picker fetches). Run-time then
  re-resolves each bound skill against the *invoker* (``resolve_invocable_skill_ids``, D5).
- ``memory_space``   → feature-flagged; author needs viewer+ (read) / editor+ (readwrite).
- ``knowledge_base`` → **managed implicitly** (the KB is welded to the agent and its index
  is not user-configurable), so it is NOT author-settable; the compat layer synthesizes it
  on read. An explicit knowledge_base binding is rejected.
