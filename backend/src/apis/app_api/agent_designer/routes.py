"""Agent Designer — the ``/agents/*`` surface (Phase 1, PR-3).

A thin alias over the evolved assistant store: the same ``apis.shared.assistants``
service functions and the same identity-based access gates as ``/assistants/*``, but
returning the **Agent** shape (``compat.to_agent_view`` → ``AgentResponse``) so callers
see ``modelConfig`` + ``bindings``. Legacy ids are valid unchanged (agentId == assistantId).

Gating: the router is mounted unconditionally but every route depends on
``require_agents_enabled`` — a 404 when ``AGENTS_API_ENABLED`` is off, so the surface
behaves as if unmounted while the feature ships incrementally. Auth is the standard SPA
cookie dependency per the CLAUDE.md app-api rule.

Deliberately excluded in Phase 1: ``test-chat`` (the only reason the assistants router is
on the architecture import-boundary allow-list — aliasing it would force a second
exception) and document sub-routes. Those stay on ``/assistants/*``. ``GET /agents`` lists
the caller's own + shared-with-them agents; ``include_public``/pagination parity is a
Phase-4 concern when the Designer consumes it.

    another browsing user. It is also never a ranking input — nothing here touches
    ``usageCount`` or the store front, because the moment report volume influenced
    placement, reporting would become a way to bury a competitor's Agent.

    Reportable means **published** (D15.3): you may report what the store offered you.
    A second report while the reporter's first is still open **updates** it rather than
    stacking (D15.4), and the response says so — without that the queue is trivially
    floodable and the count at the top of the nav stops meaning anything.

    X" as "it is broken". And ``sessionId`` may carry the conversation the user opted to
    attach; it is verified against the caller before it is stored, and silently dropped
