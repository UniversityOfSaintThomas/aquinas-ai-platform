"""Ingestion consumer for managed knowledge bases.

Triggered by an EventBridge ``ObjectCreated`` event on the RAG documents bucket. Its
whole job is to decide whether a newly uploaded document belongs to a managed
knowledge base and, if so, ingest it directly.

Routing exclusivity is the point (Requirements 10.3-10.5)
---------------------------------------------------------
The legacy pipeline is triggered by its **own**, pre-existing S3 notification on the
same bucket. That notification was deliberately left in place, so for a legacy
document this function's correct behaviour is to **do nothing at all** — the other
Lambda has already got it. Acting here as well would index the same bytes twice: two
sets of vectors, doubled ingestion cost, and duplicate chunks competing in one
result list.

So the routing table is asymmetric, and that asymmetry is intentional:

===============  =========================================================
Engine           This function
===============  =========================================================
legacy (absent)  returns immediately, ingesting nothing
managed          ingests directly and drives ``DOC#`` to a terminal state
===============  =========================================================

The one exception is a deliberate migration or dual-read pilot, which the
Migration_Worker drives and which never routes through an upload event.

Indexed is not retrievable
--------------------------
Bedrock reports a document ``INDEXED`` up to a second before it can actually be
retrieved — measured at 0.75-1.03 s. Marking a document ``complete`` on ``INDEXED``
alone produces the worst kind of bug report: the UI says the upload worked, the user
asks a question straight away, and the answer does not mention their document. So
this polls until a retrieval really returns the document, and records ``indexedAt``
and ``retrievableAt`` separately so the gap stays measurable instead of becoming
folklore.

Import boundary
---------------
Raw DynamoDB table access rather than importing ``apis.shared.assistants``, whose
``__init__`` pulls in the embeddings stack at module scope. Keeping this Lambda's
image small is a deliberate constraint — the same reason
``apis/app_api/kb_sync/records.py`` is written this way. Module-level imports are
stdlib only; everything heavy is function-local.

No in-process orchestration
---------------------------
No ``asyncio.ensure_future`` fan-out (Requirement 10.8). One invocation drives its
documents to terminal or fails and lets the event source redeliver. A background
task in a Lambda is killed when the handler returns, which turns a reported success
into a silently half-finished ingestion.

#: Terminal document states, taken from ``apis/app_api/documents/models.py``'s
#: ``DocumentStatus`` rather than invented: the facade's status filter serves only
#: ``complete``, so any drift here would silently make documents unretrievable.
STATUS_COMPLETE = "complete"
STATUS_FAILED = "failed"

#: A soft-deleted document (``document_service.soft_delete_document``): its row
#: stays, with a TTL, until cleanup has removed the vectors, the managed copy and
#: the S3 source, and only then is hard-deleted. Nothing here may move a row out
#: of this status or ingest a document in it — the retrieval filter joins on the
#: row, so reviving it to ``complete`` would serve a document its owner deleted.
STATUS_DELETING = "deleting"

#: The leading status of a born-managed first upload (``MANAGED_KB_NEW_DEFAULT``):
#: the document is uploaded and its knowledge base is still being created, so the
#: managed lifecycle is ``provisioning → uploading → complete``.
#:
#: Defined HERE, in the module that owns the managed document lifecycle, rather
#: than beside the API-side trigger, because the migration Lambda image carries
#: only ``apis/shared/kb_backend`` and ``apis/app_api/kb_migration`` — importing
#: the trigger's package from the provisioning job would fail on a cold start.
#: ``kb_upgrade.born_managed`` re-exports this name for the API side, so the two
#: halves cannot drift apart.
#:
#: Non-terminal and non-retrievable: the retrieval facade serves only
#: ``complete``, so a document in this status can never answer a question out of a
#: knowledge base that does not exist yet.
STATUS_PROVISIONING = "provisioning"

#: How long to wait for a document to become genuinely retrievable after Bedrock
#: reports it INDEXED. The observed gap is 0.75-1.03 s; the margin is wide because
#: the cost of waiting is a few seconds of Lambda time and the cost of not waiting
#: is telling a user their upload worked when it is not yet usable.
RETRIEVABLE_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30.0
RETRIEVABLE_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 0.5

#: How long ONE invocation waits for Bedrock to finish indexing.
#:
#: This has to cover the whole indexing time, because redelivery cannot. Lambda's
#: asynchronous retry is capped at **2** attempts — a hard service limit, not a
#: setting we chose — so an event gets 1 + 2 tries spread over a few minutes and
#: then dead-letters. Raising a retry policy on the EventBridge target does not
#: change that: for a Lambda target EventBridge hands the event off and the
#: function's own async retry config takes over.
#:
#: So the budget is sized from measurement, not convenience. The §5.1 benchmark
#: measured PDF ingestion at 37–264 s, and a 1.5 MB PDF in dev reached INDEXED
#: 5 m 30 s after upload — image-heavy files run longer because the vision model
#: runs per page. 10 minutes covers that with headroom and still leaves 5 minutes
#: under the Lambda's 15-minute timeout, so a slow-but-succeeding document is never
#: killed mid-wait.
#:
#: The cost of waiting is real but small: this Lambda is 1024 MB and handles one
#: user upload at a time, so a 6-minute wait is a fraction of a cent. The cost of
#: NOT waiting was a permanently stuck document with a fully retrievable copy in
#: the knowledge base and no writer left to reconcile it.
#:
#: ⚠️ Keep the sum of this and RETRIEVABLE_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS below the Lambda's
#: timeout. `tests/supply_chain/test_kb_migration_env_contract.py` asserts it
#: against the value in the CDK construct.
INDEXED_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600.0

#: 5 s rather than sub-second: over a 10-minute budget this is ~120 control-plane
#: calls instead of ~1,200, and indexing progress is measured in tens of seconds,
#: so a finer interval buys nothing.
INDEXED_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 5.0

#: Bounded retries on the record update. The event source already redelivers, so
#: this only covers a transient DynamoDB failure inside one invocation; unbounded
#: retries would burn the Lambda timeout and lose the DLQ signal.

    that are about to work.

    THE FILTER IS THE WHOLE POINT
    An earlier version searched for the document *id as the query text* and checked
    whether that document appeared in the top 5 results. A document id carries no
    meaning to an embedding model, so the search returned whatever the reranker
    liked best — measured in dev with two documents in the knowledge base, querying
    ``DOC-40e985680a63`` returned five chunks and every one of them belonged to a
    *different* document. The probe reported "not retrievable" for a document that
    was perfectly retrievable.

    That failure scales the wrong way: the more documents a knowledge base holds,
    the less likely the target appears in an unfiltered top-5, so every upload to a
    mature knowledge base would burn its full poll budget and then dead-letter. It
    only ever worked when the knowledge base held a single document, where anything
    returned was necessarily the right thing.

    An ``equals`` filter on ``document_id`` makes the question exact: chunks come
    back only for this document, so a non-empty result *is* proof of retrievability
    and an empty one is a true negative. Verified against dev: each document
    returned 5 of its own chunks, and a fabricated id returned none. ``equals`` is
    in ``ISOLATION_SAFE_FILTER_OPERATORS``, so it passes the adapter's filter
    validation.

    The timeouts default to ``None`` and are resolved from the module constants *at
    call time*, rather than being bound as default arguments. Default arguments are
    evaluated once at import, which makes them unpatchable — the first version of
    this function bound them directly and a test that shortened the window had no
