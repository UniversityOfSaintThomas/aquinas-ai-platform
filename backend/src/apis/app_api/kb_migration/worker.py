"""Migration worker: shadow → verify → promote → retain, one step per invocation.

Requirements 15, 16, 17. Each invocation takes a lease, executes **one** step for
one knowledge base, records the next state with a conditional write, and returns.
The dispatcher brings it back for the next step.

Why one step per invocation
---------------------------
A 20-document text corpus is about 3 minutes end to end, but a 20-PDF corpus can
exceed an hour: per-document parse time was measured at 37–264 s and dominates
everything else. A worker that tried to run the whole machine in one invocation
would therefore be a Lambda that sometimes finishes in three minutes and sometimes
hits its timeout — and a timeout mid-``shadow`` is indistinguishable, from the
outside, from a crash. Stepping means every interruption lands on a recorded state
with a conditional guard in front of it, which is what makes a resumed run converge
instead of duplicating (property test 6).

Nothing is mutated in place
---------------------------
The live knowledge base keeps serving from the legacy backend throughout ``shadow``
and ``verify`` (15.2, 15.3). The managed corpus is built alongside it and becomes
visible only at ``promote``, which is one conditional write. That is also why
rollback moves no data: the legacy index was never touched, so returning to it is
an attribute ``REMOVE``.

Re-ingest, never re-upload
--------------------------
Source bytes are already at
``assistants/{assistant_id}/documents/{document_id}/{filename}``, so migration
hands Bedrock the S3 location it already has (15.4). No user is ever asked to
re-supply a document, and no bytes move.

Convergence, not dual-write
---------------------------
The existing upload path stays authoritative and keeps writing to legacy for the
whole migration (16.1, 16.6). Rather than writing to both engines — which doubles
the number of ways a write can half-fail — the worker snapshots the document-id
set, migrates it, then runs catch-up passes until a pass finds nothing new (16.2,
16.3). Same converge-on-quiet shape as the crawler's consecutive-miss rule.

Each document's ``DOC#`` record is re-read immediately before it is ingested and
skipped if it has gone or is no longer ``complete`` (16.4, 16.5). Without that
re-read, a document deleted while the migration was working through a long PDF
queue would be resurrected in the managed corpus — the user deleted it, saw it
disappear, and it comes back on a different engine.

LEASE_MINUTES = 15

    ``run_shadow`` reserves the whole corpus up front so a migration that cannot

    prod every migrated knowledge base held its entire corpus in ``reservedBytes``

    ``storedBytes`` from S3, would have counted every byte twice.

    Settled per document rather than as one ``reserved -> stored`` move, because

    deleted during ``shadow`` (a legacy delete touches no counters) and documents
    added by catch-up (never reserved). So:

    1. Every ``complete`` document is claimed with ``settle_as_committed`` — which

       counted with ``add_stored``. A resumed run's claims lose, so nothing is
       counted twice.
    2. The snapshot reservation is returned whole, conditioned on the amount
       recorded when it was taken, so it is returned once.

    Between the two the corpus is briefly counted twice, the safe direction. A
