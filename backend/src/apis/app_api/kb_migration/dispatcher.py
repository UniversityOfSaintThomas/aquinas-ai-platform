"""Migration dispatcher: hand due knowledge bases to the worker, a few at a time.

Requirements 19.6, 15.14. One EventBridge tick reads the sparse ``KbWorkIndex``,
takes at most a bounded number of records, and asynchronously invokes the worker
once per record. It performs no migration itself and holds no state.

Follows ``apis/app_api/kb_sync/dispatcher.py`` closely — third use of that shape on
this table, after the sync dispatcher and the scheduled-runs dispatcher — so the
things that matter about it are already established: a bounded per-tick limit, one
broken record never starving the sweep, and metrics emitted from the tick rather
than from the worker.

Why the index makes the queue correct by physics
------------------------------------------------
``GSI7_PK``/``GSI7_SK`` are written only while a record is work-eligible
(``born_managed``, ``teardown``, ``shadow``, ``verify``, ``promote``) and ``REMOVE``d
on reaching a terminal state (a finished ``teardown`` removes the whole record).
So this dispatcher cannot see a finished knowledge base even if it wanted to: there
is no filter to get wrong, because ineligible records are not in the index. Same
convention as ``DueSyncIndex``, ``AgentDirectoryIndex`` and ``AgentReportsIndex``
on this table.

Why it no-ops rather than refusing to start
-------------------------------------------
With ``MANAGED_KB_MIGRATION_ENABLED`` off the tick returns its zeroed counts and
invokes nothing. The Lambda still exists, still runs on schedule, and still emits
metrics — which is what makes turning the flag on a change with a known blast
radius rather than the first time this code has ever executed in production.
