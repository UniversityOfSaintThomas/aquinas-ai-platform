"""Daily reconciler for managed knowledge bases.

Joins a paginated, tag-filtered ``ListKnowledgeBases`` against the KB_Records and
acts on the three ways the two sides can disagree. It exists because a managed
knowledge base is a **runtime-created, billed** resource with no CloudFormation
parent: nothing else in the system would ever notice one that our database has
forgotten about.

The join table
--------------
=============  ============================================================
Side           Action
=============  ============================================================
AWS only       Orphan. Delete **only if AWS's own ``createdAt`` is >24 h old**
Record only    Mark ``vectorState: missing``. **Never delete the record**
Both           Re-anchor ``storedBytes`` + ``totalBytes`` (quota)
=============  ============================================================

A record in ``migrationState: teardown`` takes none of those actions, on either
side. Its agent has been deleted and the migration worker is removing the
knowledge base and then the record, a job that spans 15-30+ minutes of
dispatcher ticks. Its knowledge base being ``DELETING`` or gone is the teardown
working, not vectors going missing, and its bytes are about to stop mattering.
It is counted as ``tearing_down`` so the report still accounts for it.

Every record-side write is also guarded on the record still existing
(:func:`records.update_if_present`). The pass reads all records first and then
walks AWS, so a teardown can finish in between: the knowledge base is gone, the
record is gone, and this run still holds the record in its snapshot. An
unguarded ``UpdateItem`` would then recreate it as a ghost ``KB#`` item holding
only the attributes this module sets.

Two of those three rows are counter-intuitive, and each is the way it is because
the intuitive version destroys something.

**Age-gate on AWS's ``createdAt``, never on discovery time.** The tempting
implementation records when the reconciler first *saw* an unknown knowledge base
and waits 24 hours from there. That is wrong in both directions. A reconciler that
was down for a week comes back and treats every knowledge base in the account as
newly discovered — so either it waits another 24 hours on genuine week-old
orphans, or, if the comparison is written the other way round, it deletes every
knowledge base that is mid-provisioning right now, including creates that are 40
seconds old and about to succeed. AWS's ``createdAt`` is a fact about the
resource, is identical on every run, and does not depend on this process's uptime.
It is obtained from ``GetKnowledgeBase``, because ``KnowledgeBaseSummary`` does
not carry it.

**A record with no AWS knowledge base is a stale pointer, not a dead corpus.** It
means the *vectors* are gone. The source bytes are still in S3 and the ``DOC#``
records are still valid and still ``complete``, so the knowledge base can be
rebuilt from them on the next ingest, and the owner never has to re-upload
anything. The record is the only pointer to that recoverable corpus, so deleting
it is the one action here that loses user data — which is why
:func:`mark_vector_state_missing` is the entire response and no code path in this
module removes a KB_Record.

Report-only, and armed separately
---------------------------------
This ships **disarmed** (Requirement 14.7, 19.7). It logs exactly what it would
have deleted and deletes nothing, and it runs that way for weeks so its judgement
can be checked against real data before it is trusted with a delete. Arming is one
flag, ``MANAGED_KB_RECONCILER_ARMED``, and an **empty string reads as off**
(Requirement 19.8) — an unset GitHub Actions variable expands to ``""``, which is
how a flag that is obviously off ends up looking truthy to ``if os.environ.get``.

The per-run limit applies in **both** modes, so the report says what an armed run
would actually do. A report listing 500 intended deletions from a run that would
only ever perform 25 is a misleading artifact, and the whole point of the
report-only period is that the artifact can be trusted.

Import boundary
---------------
Module-level imports are stdlib plus the stdlib-only ``kb_backend`` modules;
``boto3`` is function-local, and nothing here reaches ``apis.shared.assistants``.
DynamoDB is accessed through the raw table resource, matching
``kb_migration/ingestion_consumer.py`` and ``kb_sync/records.py``.
