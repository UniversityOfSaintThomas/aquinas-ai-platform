"""Tear down a deleted agent's managed knowledge base: the worker's ``teardown`` step.

Deleting an agent (``DELETE /assistants/{id}``) or purging a project (its harness)
removes every row in the agent's partition except the ``KB#`` record, which it
queues here instead (:func:`queue_teardown`, app-api's half of this module).
Before this step existed, that record and the Bedrock knowledge base it points at
were simply left behind: the knowledge base stayed ``ACTIVE`` and billed, and
nothing would ever remove it, because the reconciler never removes a record by
design and ships disarmed.

The delete runs here, not in app-api, because this worker holds the provisioning
grant (``bedrock:DeleteKnowledgeBase``/``DeleteDataSource``/``ListKnowledgeBases``)
and app-api is deliberately never given it. It runs under the worker lease the
dispatcher hands out, which gives it the two properties it needs for free: it
cannot start while a provisioning or migration step still holds the knowledge
base, and a teardown killed mid-poll is handed back until it finishes.

What one step does, in order:

1. Find the knowledge base: ``awsKbId`` on the record, or, for a record that was
   mid-provisioning when its agent was deleted, a knowledge base carrying the name
   provisioning gives it (the create can land before its id is recorded).
2. Delete it through the tombstoned saga (``tombstones.delete_knowledge_base``):
   tombstone first, the data source (best effort), the knowledge base, poll until
   AWS stops listing it, clear the tombstone, and only then remove the ``KB#``
   record. With no knowledge base to delete, the record is simply removed.
3. Clear any per-document tombstones: those documents went with the knowledge base.

Every failure re-queues the record rather than failing it. ``failed`` is terminal,
and a teardown that stops trying is exactly the silent bill this exists to end.
``DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL`` is re-checked daily rather than every tick, because it is an
operator state that waiting does not clear.

#: How long one teardown step waits for AWS to stop listing the knowledge base.
#:
#: Longer than the saga's shared default (``KB_DELETE_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``, 480 s,
#: sized on a 2-6 minute measurement). Every managed knowledge base torn down on dev
#: on 2026-09-25 (five of them) was still ``DELETING`` at 480 s and gone by about
#: 10 minutes, so each teardown took two worker runs and about 30 minutes. 780 s
#: fits one run inside the worker's 900 s Lambda timeout with 2 minutes to spare
#: for the lease, the data-source delete and the bookkeeping. It is this step's own
#: value, not the shared default: the reconciler deletes several orphans in one
#: 15-minute run and cannot afford 13 minutes each.
#:
#: Read at call time (see ``tombstones`` on why a bound default can't be patched).
