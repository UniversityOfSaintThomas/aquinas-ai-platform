"""Born-managed provisioning job: build the knowledge base, then own the handoff.

The worker-side half of ``MANAGED_KB_NEW_DEFAULT``. The API-side half
(:mod:`apis.app_api.kb_upgrade.born_managed`) does three conditional writes on the
first document upload — create the record, declare the engine managed, queue this
job — and returns in milliseconds. Everything slow happens here.

Why the ingestion trigger lives in this job and not in the S3 event
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The S3 ``ObjectCreated`` event for the first document fires within seconds of the
client's upload. ``CreateKnowledgeBase`` takes 47–124 s to ``ACTIVE`` and the whole
provision takes minutes. Lambda's asynchronous retry is capped at **2** attempts —
a hard service limit, not a setting — so the event is exhausted and dead-lettered
long before there is a knowledge base to ingest into. That is precisely the §5.37
dead-letter failure that leaves a document permanently invisible, and designing a
new feature that walks into it on its very first document would be a choice.

So the managed ingestion consumer **defers** while a record is born-managed and
unprovisioned (a benign no-op, no dead-letter), and this job ingests the pending
documents itself once the knowledge base exists. Correctness then rests on the
dispatcher's work-key queue and the worker lease — retried until terminal, leased
so two workers cannot both provision — rather than on a two-try event window.

Failure means legacy, never limbo
---------------------------------
Managed intent with no knowledge base is a dead end in both directions: the legacy
pipeline skips the agent's uploads because the record says managed, and the managed
one cannot serve because there is nothing to serve from. So a provisioning failure
does not merely stop — it **removes** ``retrievalEngine``, returning the agent to
legacy-by-absence, and fails the waiting documents with a message that says to try
again. A re-upload then takes the legacy path and works. See :func:`_fall_back_to_legacy`.

Import boundary
---------------
Module-level imports are stdlib only, like every other module in this package: this
code ships in the size-constrained migration Lambda image. Everything heavy —
boto3, the provisioner, the ingestion consumer — is imported inside the functions
that need it.
