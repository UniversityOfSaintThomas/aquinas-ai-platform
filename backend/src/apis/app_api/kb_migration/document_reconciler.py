"""Dead-letter reconciler for stranded managed-KB documents.

Task 16.5 (HANDOFF §5.37). The companion to :mod:`reconciler`, which reconciles
whole knowledge bases against ``ListKnowledgeBases``; this one reconciles
individual ``DOC#`` rows against Bedrock's *document* view.

The gap it closes
-----------------
On the managed path a document's ``DOC#`` status is written by exactly one writer:
the ingestion consumer (``kb_migration/ingestion_consumer.py``). That consumer
polls Bedrock until the document is genuinely retrievable and only then writes
``complete``. It is the right design — but it is the *only* writer, and it runs
inside a Lambda whose asynchronous retry is capped at **2** attempts (a hard
service limit). When an event exhausts those retries and dead-letters, the row is
left in a non-terminal state (``uploading`` / ``chunking`` / ``embedding``) with
**nothing left to revisit it** — even though Bedrock frequently finished indexing
the document seconds after the final attempt was dead-lettered, so the content is
sitting in the knowledge base fully retrievable.

That combination is invisible and permanent, because the retrieval status filter
(``rag_service._filter_vectors_by_document_status``) serves **only** ``complete``
documents. A stranded row's chunks are dropped from every query: the user was told
their upload worked, the content really is in the knowledge base, and the
assistant will never cite it. Two such documents occurred in dev and both needed a
manual DynamoDB edit.

This module is the missing second writer. Once a day it finds ``DOC#`` rows stuck
non-terminal past a grace period, asks Bedrock the ground truth for each, and — the
§5.37 case — drives a stranded-but-retrievable document to ``complete``. It also
handles the two neighbouring outcomes the same probe reveals: a document Bedrock
reports ``FAILED`` is driven to ``failed`` (it was never going to recover), and a
document Bedrock has never heard of (``NOT_FOUND`` — dead-lettered *before* the
ingest was ever accepted) is **re-ingested** from the bytes still in S3. That
re-ingest is the one-click retry of task 14.4 arriving on a schedule instead of a
button.

Ground truth comes from the consumer, not a second copy
-------------------------------------------------------
Every decision here reuses the consumer's own probes — :func:`document_status`
(``GetKnowledgeBaseDocuments``), the ``equals``-on-``document_id`` retrievability
search, its status-set constants, and its terminal-write function. That reuse is
deliberate: those functions carry three hard-won lessons (§5.37 the poll budget,
§5.38 that an unfiltered retrievability search finds the wrong document, §5.39
that the live service returns statuses the SDK enum omits). A reconciler that
re-derived any of them would be a fourth place for the same bug to live. The one
thing this module does *not* reuse is the consumer's *polling* — it takes a single
retrievability reading per document rather than waiting, because it is sweeping a
fleet, not shepherding one upload.

Report-only, and armed separately
----------------------------------
Modelled on :mod:`reconciler`. It ships **disarmed**: it logs exactly what it
would have done and writes nothing, so its judgement can be checked against real
data before it is trusted to correct records. Arming is one flag,
:data:`FLAG_DOC_RECONCILER_ARMED`, and an **empty string reads as off** — an unset
GitHub Actions variable expands to ``""``. The per-run action limit
(:func:`max_actions_per_run`) applies in **both** modes, so a report never claims
more corrections than an armed run would actually make.

The grace gate is a pure function of the row's own ``updatedAt``, never of
discovery time — the same discipline as the KB reconciler's ``createdAt`` gate. A
row whose ``updatedAt`` cannot be read is left alone: without proof that a document
has been stuck *longer than a legitimate in-flight ingestion could take*, touching
it risks racing an upload that is still, correctly, being worked on.

Import boundary
---------------
Module-level imports are stdlib plus the stdlib-only ``ingestion_consumer`` /
``reconciler`` / ``kb_backend.records`` siblings; ``boto3`` and the heavy
``ManagedKbBackend`` are function-local. DynamoDB is reached through the raw table
resource, matching every other module in this package.

# minus its terminal members. ``deleting`` is deliberately NOT here: a
# soft-deleted document is being removed on purpose and must never be resurrected
# to ``complete``.
#
# ``provisioning`` (born-managed, MANAGED_KB_NEW_DEFAULT) is here as the long-
# horizon backstop for a first document whose provisioning job was killed between
# building the knowledge base and handing the document over. It is safe to include
# precisely because the sweep already skips any record with no ``awsKbId`` — while
# the knowledge base does not exist there is nothing to probe, so such a document is
# never even considered. Once it does exist, a document still parked here past the
# grace window probes ``NOT_FOUND`` and is re-ingested from S3, which is exactly the
