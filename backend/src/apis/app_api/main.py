# gzip the JSON surface. Nothing compressed app-api responses before this:
# CloudFront's `/api/*` behaviour is deliberately `compress: false` so the
# edge never buffers a `text/event-stream`, which leaves compression to the
# origin — the only layer that knows a response's content type rather than
# guessing from its path. Measured on this repo's own payload shapes at
# `compresslevel=6`: ~3.0x on a conversation-history response, ~3.9x on a
# 5,000-row spreadsheet-shaped one. Level 9 (Starlette's default) buys 3%
# more for 4x the CPU on the large case, so 6 — zlib's own default — it is.
#
# `StreamSafeGZipMiddleware` passes `text/event-stream` and already-encoded
# bodies through untouched *and un-buffered*; see its module docstring for
# why the second half of that matters on the chat path.
#
# Sits one layer inside ProxiedRedirect so it compresses everything the app
# emits — including the error bodies CSRF and SessionRefresh return — while
# leaving ProxiedRedirect genuinely outermost. The two never collide:
# ProxiedRedirect reads and rewrites only `Location`, on responses (3xx)
# whose bodies are empty or below the compression threshold anyway.
