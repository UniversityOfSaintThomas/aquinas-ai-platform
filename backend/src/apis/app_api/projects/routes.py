"""``/projects`` — Shared Projects CRUD, members, transfer and leave (shared-projects §5, PR-1.2),
the people directory for inviting (PR-1.3), settings with version history (PR-1.5a), and the
caller's own and shared tasks (PR-1.6).

Every route authenticates by session cookie first and only then applies the
``PROJECTS_ENABLED`` kill switch, so an unauthenticated caller always sees 401
(the auth sweep requires it) and a signed-in caller sees 404 while the feature
is off. Authorization is entirely the service's: each handler is a thin
translation from ``ProjectError`` subclasses to status codes.

Deleting is two deliberate steps: ``PATCH {"status": "archived"}``, then
``DELETE``, which purges the project, its harness Agent and the harness's
documents. ``DELETE`` on an active project is a 409 naming the first step.
