"""Turn a finished batch of tool calls into one line a person would say.

The SPA can already describe a tool call deterministically ("Listed 4
assignments") from the input and result it holds. What it cannot do is read
the *content* of those results and say which thing was found — "Found the
Syllabus Acknowledgment assignment in BIO 101 (25 pts, due Aug 29)". That
needs a model, and this is the cheapest honest way to get one.

SIDE-CHANNEL, NOT AGENT CONTEXT
-------------------------------
Structured exactly like `generate_conversation_title`: its own Bedrock call,
on its own messages, run as an asyncio task concurrent with the agent stream.
It never touches `agent.messages`, never appends to the conversation, and
therefore adds **nothing** to the cacheable prefix — the CLAUDE.md
prompt-cache contract is untouched and no turn pays a cache re-write for a
display string.

Its own spend is bounded by construction: Nova Micro, a hard cap on the number
of calls described, and per-call input/result truncation applied twice (once at
capture in `AgentStatusHook`, once here). A wide batch of large results costs
roughly the same as a narrow one.

FAILURE IS A DOWNGRADE, NOT AN ERROR
------------------------------------
Every failure path returns `None`. The SPA then keeps the deterministic line
it has been showing since the tools started — the user sees a slightly less
specific sentence and nothing else changes. That is why this is safe to leave
on by default, and why nothing here is allowed to raise into the stream.

You are given the tool calls the assistant made and what they returned. Write a single line a non-technical person would understand, naming the specific things that were found.

Guidelines:
- One line, maximum 90 characters. No trailing period.
- Past tense, starting with a verb: "Found", "Listed", "Searched", "Created", "Updated", "Read".
- Name the specific result: the course, the file, the assignment, the count. That specificity is the entire point.
- Never mention tool names, parameters, IDs, JSON, or "the API".
- Never mention that you are an AI or that tools were used.
- If a call failed, say so plainly: "Couldn't reach Canvas".

Calls: list_courses -> 3 courses (BIO 101, HIST 210, CS 121)
