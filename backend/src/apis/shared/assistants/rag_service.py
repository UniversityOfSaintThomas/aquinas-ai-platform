"""RAG service for assistant knowledge base search and prompt augmentation

This module is the **facade** over the knowledge base seam. It resolves which
backend serves an assistant's knowledge base, delegates the search, and then
applies the properties that must hold identically on every backend. It contains
no retrieval logic of its own: what an S3 Vectors response looks like now lives
in ``apis.shared.kb_backend.s3vectors_backend``.

What lives here, and why here
-----------------------------
Four rules sit above the seam rather than inside either adapter, because a rule
implemented twice is a rule that will eventually differ (Requirement 3):

* **The access check.** No backend is contacted until the invoking user's grant
  has been resolved (Requirement 25.1). It is above the seam because the answer
  does not depend on the engine, and because Bedrock's own isolation features are
  not trusted to be the authority — see ``kb_access``.
* **The document-status filter.** Dropped chunks whose parent document is not
  ``complete``. Kept on both backends during parity even though managed
  ingestion makes it largely redundant — removing it in the same change that
  swaps the engine would make any difference in results unattributable.
* **``top_k`` narrowing.** Applied *after* the status filter, which is the order
  the legacy path has always used: filter-then-slice, so an incomplete document
  cannot silently shrink a five-chunk answer.
* **The context cap, per engine.** ``augment_prompt_with_context`` takes an
  explicit ``max_context_length``; :func:`resolve_context_cap` decides it from
  the assistant's engine. Legacy keeps the historical 2,000 characters; managed
  gets :data:`MANAGED_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (8,000). This is a *deliberate*
  managed-only asymmetry, amended into Requirement 3.2 on 2026-09-04 after
  measurement: holding the *character* cap identical across backends did **not**
  hold retrieval identical, because Bedrock's chunks are ~3x the size of the
  Docling chunks the 2,000 figure was sized for — so at 2,000, four of managed's
  five reranked chunks never reached the model and answers went wrong (HANDOFF
  §5.40). Capping per engine restores parity in the unit that actually matters:
  chunks reaching the model, not characters. The evaluation's §13.6 "no
  correctness change 2,000→20,000" covered single-fact lookups only and flagged
  multi-chunk synthesis — the case that broke — as untested.

The dual-read pilot
-------------------
Also above the seam, and for the same reason: comparing two backends is not a
thing either backend can do. The facade starts the observational managed read
before awaiting legacy and detaches the comparison afterwards, so a piloted turn
waits exactly as long as an unpiloted one (Requirement 18.5). Legacy is always
what is served. See ``kb_backend.dual_read``.

Score direction
---------------The seam speaks **relevance** (higher is better). This facade still emits a
``distance`` key (lower is better), derived by exact negation, because
``app_api/assistants/routes.py`` puts that value in an HTTP response body that a
client already reads. The rename stops at the seam; no caller has to change.

# Managed knowledge bases can hand back near-identical content two ways, and both

# → ``augment_prompt_with_context`` and the ``citations_for_storage`` build off the
# same ``context_chunks`` in ``inference_api/chat/routes.py``):
#
#   1. The image-to-text parser on poster/infographic PDFs repeats a descriptive
#      sentence several times *inside* one chunk.
#   2. Fixed-window chunking (~300 tokens, 20% overlap) lets reranking surface two
#      chunks that are substantially the same text.
#
# Deduplication lives here, above the seam, for the same reason the other parity
# rules do: it must hold identically on every backend. It is a no-op on
# already-distinct results, so legacy — which rarely duplicates — is unaffected.
# It deliberately does NOT change chunking or re-ingest anything; it cleans the
# retrieved set at answer time.

#: Segments shorter than this (normalized character length) are never dropped as
#: intra-chunk repeats. Short recurring lines — a header, "Yes.", a label — can

#: descriptive sentences.
