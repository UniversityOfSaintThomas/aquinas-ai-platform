# (see ``assistants.versions``). A governance marker that can never fire is worse than none:
# the next reader assumes it is doing something. Removed with `approvedInstructionsHash`.

# Who can actually *open* a listed Agent — `visibility` projected onto the question the
# store never asks.
#
# **Publication and reachability are separate axes, and the store only guards one of them.**
# `GET /agents/store` is a pure sparse-GSI5 read with no access check, while
# `GET /agents/{id}` enforces `get_assistant_with_access_check`. Nothing in the listing
# lifecycle touches `visibility` — deliberately, since approving a store listing is not
# consent to widen access — so a PRIVATE or SHARED Agent can be approved and shelved, and
# every user who is not the owner (or on the share list) gets a tile that 404s when tapped.
#
# Both live dev listings were in exactly this state when this was found: one PRIVATE, one
# SHARED. The admin copy half-knew ("members can only open one they could reach on their
# own"), but every guard was on listing *state*, never on visibility, and neither the
# author at submit nor the reviewer at approve was told.
#
# ⚠️ **This is a warning, not a gate.** SHARED-to-a-team is a legitimate thing to publish,
# and blocking it — or silently flipping visibility on approve — would be the
# `allowedAppRoles` trap again: a store decision quietly rewriting an access decision.
# Derived on read, never stored, so it cannot go stale against `visibility`.

    the author edits between the reviewer reading and the reviewer approving, which is a
    narrower instance of the very bug versioning exists to close. Approval then promotes
    an existing version rather than capturing a new one.

    **What is in here is exactly what determines behavior or presentation.** Instructions
    are the obvious one, but swapping a bound tool or skill changes behavior just as much,
    and the model choice changes cost and answer quality — so ``bindings`` and
    ``modelSettings`` are frozen alongside. ``name``/``description``/``tagline``/``emoji``/
    ``iconKey``/``starters`` are what the reviewer actually read on the shelf, and
    ``category``/``publisherId`` are the placement and attribution they approved.

    ⚠️ **Deliberately absent: ``ownerId``, ``visibility``, ``status``.** Ownership governs
    edit rights and ``visibility`` is the independent access gate the marketplace spec is
    emphatic about keeping separate from ``listing.state``. Freezing either into a version
    would fuse two axes this codebase has worked to keep apart — a snapshot could then
    out-vote a later access decision, which is precisely the ``allowedAppRoles`` trap.
    ``status`` is a draft/complete lifecycle flag on the author's record, not a property
    of a reviewed artifact.

    Every optional field mirrors ``Assistant``'s own optionality rather than defaulting to
    an empty container, because absent and empty are different claims there: absent
    ``bindings`` means "synthesize the legacy KB binding via compat", ``[]`` means "binds
    nothing". Collapsing them would silently change what a legacy Agent resolves to on the

    The gap this closes: before it, a reviewer had a name, an author, a category and a

    read, and ``get_assistant_with_access_check`` refuses a non-owner outright on a PRIVATE
    Agent — so the person deciding whether to publish something could not read its system
    prompt, could not see what it binds, and on a **first** submission saw no content at
    all, because a diff against nothing is empty by construction.

    ⚠️ **The snapshot, never the live record, and that is the whole design.** Widening the
    user-facing ``GET /agents/{id}`` for admins would have been fewer lines and wrong: it
    serves the author's *draft*, which the author can edit between the reviewer reading it
    and the reviewer approving it. ``AgentVersion`` exists precisely to close that window
    (it is cut at submission, not at approval), and ``review_listing`` promotes
    ``submitted_version`` — so reading anything else would show an admin one configuration
    and publish another. Reading the snapshot also sidesteps the PRIVATE 403 without
    loosening anyone's access gate: this is an admin projection of a frozen artifact, not a
    hole in ``get_assistant_with_access_check``.

    Disclosure note: ``instructions`` reaches a marketplace admin here, deliberately. You
    cannot review what you cannot read, and the review diff already discloses them on every
    *update*; what this changes is that a first submission is no longer the one case where
    the reviewer is asked to approve prose nobody showed them.
