"""Square-icon storage for Agents (Marketplace Phase 4, D5).

An Agent's identity in the store is a 512×512 square icon. The **bytes live in S3 and
the record carries only the object key** — the same rule MCP App icons learned the hard
way against the 400 KB DynamoDB item limit, except here the limit would be hit by design
rather than by accident, since the icon ceiling *is* 400 KB.

Validation, normalization (including the EXIF-stripping re-encode) and the S3 put/get/
delete live in :mod:`apis.shared.images.icons` — managed models attach icons the same
way, and one validator is the point. What stays here is the part that is about Agents:
the key layout and the URL that serves it.

Storage
-------
Objects land in the existing assistants asset bucket
(``S3_ASSISTANTS_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME`` → ``{prefix}-rag-documents``), under the same
``assistants/{agent_id}/`` prefix that assistant documents already use:

    assistants/{agent_id}/icons/{sha256[:16]}.{png|jpg}

Lifecycle: replacing or removing an icon deletes the previous object
(``agent_designer/services/icon_service.py``), and deleting the agent deletes the whole
``icons/`` folder (:func:`delete_agent_icons`). Nothing the app writes references a key
after its agent is gone: version snapshots and share rows go with the record, and a
listed agent can't be deleted at all. (``PATCH /admin/agents/{id}/listing`` and publisher
profiles accept a free-text ``iconKey`` the SPA never sends; one hand-pointed at another
agent's icon would drop to the generated fallback when that agent is deleted, because
the serve route 404s a key whose object is gone.)
