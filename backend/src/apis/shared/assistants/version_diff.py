"""What changed between two Agent snapshots (version-snapshots §6.1).

The reviewer's actual question is *"what changed since I approved this?"*, and before this
they could not see it — the queue showed a submission with no reference to what it replaces.
A resubmission that fixes a typo should be approvable in seconds; one that rewrites the
instructions should be impossible to miss.

Pure functions over two ``AgentVersion`` objects. No I/O, no HTTP shapes: the service layer
loads the pair and the route projects the result, so the comparison itself stays trivially
testable against hand-built versions.

**Two decisions worth stating.**

*The instructions diff is computed server-side.* A client-side diff library would render
more prettily, but it would mean a new SPA dependency (the repo pins exactly and does not
add packages casually) and a second implementation of "did this change" that can disagree
with the field-level answer. ``difflib`` is in the standard library and the two answers come
from one place.

*A field is "changed" by value equality, not by identity of formatting.* Two versions whose
``bindings`` differ only in list order genuinely differ — order is meaningful to the
resolver — so no normalization is applied. The one exception is whitespace-only instruction
edits, which are reported as changed but produce an empty line-diff; the reviewer sees the
field flagged and an empty diff, which is the honest rendering of "something moved but no
line did".
