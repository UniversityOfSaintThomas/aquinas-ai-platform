"""Agent Designer Phase 1 — legacy-Assistant → Agent compat mapping (D2).

The Agent contract evolves the ``rag-assistants`` store IN PLACE: there is no
parallel table and no migration. A legacy Assistant row (one with no ``bindings`` /
``modelConfig`` attributes) is projected into the Agent shape *on read* by the pure
functions here — nothing is ever backfilled.

Key grounding facts (verified against the live schema):

- **No per-assistant model exists today.** The model is resolved per invocation
  (request → user default → system default). So an absent ``modelConfig`` maps to
  ``None`` meaning "resolve exactly as today" — we do NOT fabricate a model id (R1).
- **The KB is not first-class yet (F4 deferred).** ``vector_index_id`` is a *shared*
  index name, "not user-configurable". The only stable per-Assistant KB identity is
  the assistant id itself (retrieval filters vectors by ``assistant_id``). So the
  synthesized ``knowledge_base`` binding uses ``ref == assistant_id`` (R4). When F4
  lands, this ref becomes a real KB id with no shape change here.

NOTE: bindings carry *refs only*, never bodies — the METADATA item is 400 KB-capped
and already holds the full instructions. Any future kind needing a per-binding payload
must go to a child row (``AST#{id}/BINDING#…``), not inline here.
