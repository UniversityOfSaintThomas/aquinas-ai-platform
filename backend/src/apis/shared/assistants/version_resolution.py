"""Which Agent configuration a caller actually runs, and which one they are shown (§4).

One question, one answer, one place. ``resolve_invocation_agent`` takes the live Agent
record an access check has already admitted, and returns the ``Assistant`` this caller
should run:

| Caller                                        | Gets                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Anyone who pinned it or opened it from the store | The published snapshot |
| The **owner**                                 | Their own draft          |
| Anyone, when nothing is published              | The live record          |

``resolve_display_agent`` answers the same question for the marketplace **detail read**,
and differs on exactly one row: editors see the draft too. ``resolve_review_agent`` answers
it for a marketplace **reviewer**, and differs on every row — the artifact a decision is
about is the *submitted* snapshot, which neither of the others ever serves. The three are
kept side by side here rather than merged, because the reasons they differ are easy to lose
and expensive to get wrong in any direction — see each function's docstring.

This is deliberately *not* in ``versions.py`` (pure, no I/O) or in
``version_repository.py`` (persistence). Deciding which version a person runs is policy,
and policy that reads like this — a short function with the whole table in view — is much
harder to get subtly wrong than the same three branches spread across a route handler.

**Two things it is not.**

It is **not an access check.** The caller has already been admitted by
``get_assistant_with_access_check``; this only chooses *which configuration* to run. It
never widens or narrows who may reach an Agent, which is why ``AgentVersion`` carries no
``visibility`` and why the overlay in ``versions.apply_version`` leaves identity fields on
the live record.

It is **not a fallback to the draft on error.** A published Agent whose snapshot cannot be
read raises. Silently serving the draft instead would reintroduce the exact hole this epic
closed — unreviewed instructions reaching a pinned user — and it would do it precisely when
something is already wrong. Failing the turn is the safe direction.

    Widening it to editors would mean a share grant quietly became a way to bypass review,

    The third caller of the same question, and the one whose answer differs most: a
    reviewer reads and test-drives the artifact a decision is *about*, which is neither the
    published snapshot nor the author's draft.

    | Listing state        | Reviews            |

    | ``in_review``        | ``submittedVersion`` |

    ⚠️ **``in_review`` reads ``submittedVersion`` because that is what approval promotes**
    (``listing_service.review_listing``). The live record is the author's draft and they can
    keep editing it while the row sits in the queue — the window ``AgentVersion`` exists to
    close, since a version is cut at submission rather than at approval. Reading anything
    else would show a reviewer one configuration and publish another.

    ⚠️ **Every other state reads ``publishedVersion``, and that is not a fallback.**
    ``submittedVersion`` is a high-water mark that deliberately survives a decision, so on a
    ``withdrawal_requested`` listing — where nothing is pending, and the question is whether
    to pull what is *live* — it names a snapshot the store never served.

    Returns ``(assistant, None)`` when neither pointer resolves: a submission that predates
    version snapshots, or a pointer to a version that is gone. Unlike ``resolve_invocation_agent``
    this **does not raise** on a missing snapshot, because there is nothing unsafe about a
    reviewer reading the live record as long as they are told that is what they are reading —
    the ``None`` is that signal, and both callers surface it (``snapshotUnavailable`` on the
    review read; the preview banner on the test drive). Raising would leave a reviewer with a
    row in their queue and no way to look at it.

    The same question ``resolve_invocation_agent`` answers, for the page rather than the
    turn — and it has to be answered, because the detail read is where a store user decides
    whether to open an Agent. Serving the author's draft there means the page describes an
    unreviewed configuration while invocation runs the approved one: a different name, a
    different summary, and — since ``capabilities`` is resolved from ``bindings`` — a list
    of tools the published Agent does not actually have.

    **One row differs from invocation, deliberately: editors see the draft.** For a turn the
    line is owner-only, because an editor *running* the unpublished result would turn a
    share grant into a way around review. For a read the opposite is required — the Agent
    Designer loads this same endpoint, so handing an editor the published snapshot would
    populate the edit form with the approved copy and their next save would silently revert
    the owner's draft. ``can_edit`` is therefore the ``INSTRUCTIONS_PERMISSIONS`` set the
    route already computes: the people trusted with the system prompt are exactly the people
    who must see the draft.

    Passed as a bool rather than the permission string so this module keeps knowing nothing
    about the route's vocabulary.

    Raises ``AgentVersionUnavailableError`` if a published version is named but missing —
    the same refusal as invocation, for the same reason. Such an Agent has no store tile
