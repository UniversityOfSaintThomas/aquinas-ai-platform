"""KB_Record persistence for the managed knowledge base migration.

Records live in the **existing** assistants table as siblings of the assistant's
``METADATA`` row, preserving the adjacency-list convention::

    PK = AST#{assistant_id}
    SK = KB#{app_kb_id}                        # app_kb_id == assistant_id this phase
    SK = KBTOMB#{app_kb_id}                    # whole-KB tombstone
    SK = KBTOMB#{app_kb_id}#DOC#{document_id}  # per-document tombstone

Three invariants are load-bearing. Each is enforced here rather than left to
callers, because each fails silently when violated:

**1. Absence means legacy.** ``retrievalEngine`` is written *only* as
``"managed"``. Nothing here ever writes ``"s3vectors"`` onto a record that did
not already carry it. That is what makes this migration zero-backfill: every
existing knowledge base is already correct by virtue of having no opinion, and
rollback is a single attribute removal rather than a data rewrite. A backfill
that "helpfully" stamped the legacy value on 1,692 records would convert a
pointer flip into a migration of its own.

**2. Every transition is conditional.** These functions are called from a
dispatcher that fans out to concurrent workers, so a read-then-write would let
two workers both believe they won. Each transition therefore carries a DynamoDB
``ConditionExpression`` and surfaces the loss as :class:`TransitionLost` rather
than an opaque ``ClientError``.

**3. Sparse work keys are removed, not just ignored.** ``GSI7_PK``/``GSI7_SK``
exist only while a record is eligible for background work. On reaching a terminal
state they are ``REMOVE``d, so an ineligible knowledge base is invisible to the
dispatcher's query *by physics* rather than by filter. This matters more than the
usual sparse-index argument because the dispatcher creates and deletes billed AWS
resources: a missing key can only ever mean "do nothing", whereas a stale key
means "act on something nobody asked you to act on".

Import boundary
---------------
This module deliberately talks to DynamoDB through the raw table resource instead
of importing ``apis.shared.assistants``. That package's ``__init__`` imports
``rag_service``, which imports the embeddings stack at module scope; pulling it
into the migration Lambda image would blow the image-size budget. The same
constraint is why ``apis/app_api/kb_sync/records.py`` is written this way, and
this module follows it: **module-level imports are stdlib only**, and ``boto3``
is imported inside the functions that need it. ``kb_backend/__init__.py`` is
intentionally empty so importing a submodule pulls in nothing else.

    across before anything is switched. Here there is no corpus and nothing to
    carry — the engine is declared first precisely so the first document is
    picked up by the managed pipeline instead of the legacy one.

    That ordering is the whole point. The legacy ingestion handler skips a
    document only when its record already resolves to ``managed``
    (``handler._resolve_engine``), so a knowledge base that became managed
    *after* its first upload would have that document indexed on legacy,
    answered from legacy, and then indexed a second time on managed.

    Two guards, both necessary:

    * ``attribute_not_exists(retrievalEngine)`` — never re-declare. A record that

      built may be declared this way. Without it a torn-down (``deleting``) record
      could be resurrected as managed with no knowledge base behind it.

    ``upgradeNoticeDismissedAt`` is stamped here on purpose. The upgrade card
    reads a managed record as ``phase="succeeded"`` and offers the one-time "your
    knowledge base was upgraded" notice; a knowledge base that was never on legacy
    has nothing to be congratulated about, so the notice is retired before it can
    ever be shown.

    * ``attribute_not_exists(retrievalEngine)`` — this knowledge base has not

      *after* a successful promotion, so a worker that crashed between the

      value, but a fresh ``promotedAt`` that overwrites the real cutover moment and
      a second ``KbMigrationPromoted``. Worse, two concurrent workers would both
      succeed, which is precisely what Requirement 15.10 forbids. Found by the
      convergence property test, which counted two promotions across a crash at
      the state transition. Rollback ``REMOVE``s the attribute, so this does not
      block a deliberate re-promotion.
    * ``migrationState = promote`` — only a record that reached the cutover step
      may cut over.
    * ``migrationGeneration = :gen`` — a worker whose lease expired and whose
      generation has been superseded cannot promote on stale information.

      during migration on a backend nobody reads any more. Comparing two
      document paths keeps the check atomic with the write; passing the total in
      as a value would let it go stale between read and write.
