"""Per-owner byte cap accounting for managed knowledge bases.

Managed storage is billed at $5.00/GB-month, roughly 35x what S3 Vectors costs
today. At the measured average of 1.13 MB per user that is about $169/month across
the fleet — but nothing structural stops one user uploading far more, and 30,000
users at 100 MB each would be 3 TB, or about $15,000/month. The cap is what turns
"unlikely" into "impossible".

Why an accumulator instead of the obvious condition
---------------------------------------------------
The natural way to express this is::

    ConditionExpression="storedBytes + reservedBytes + :n <= :cap"

**DynamoDB rejects that.** Condition expressions compare operands; they cannot do
arithmetic. Verified directly: the parser fails with ``Cannot parse condition
starting at:+ reserved <= :cap``.

So the arithmetic is moved to the client, where it is free. A single
``totalBytes`` accumulator is maintained as the invariant
``totalBytes == storedBytes + reservedBytes``, and the guard compares it against a
**literal computed before the call**::

    ADD totalBytes :n, reservedBytes :n
    CONDITION totalBytes <= :max_before      where :max_before = cap - n

That is a single atomic conditional update, so N concurrent reservations cannot
collectively overshoot. The alternative — read, compute, write — has a window
between the read and the write in which another writer commits, which is exactly
the race a cap exists to prevent.

Reserve / commit / release, not just "add"
-----------------------------------------
Ingestion is not instantaneous: a 50 KiB PDF measured 68-264 seconds. Counting
bytes only on success would let a user start unlimited concurrent uploads that are
each individually under the cap and collectively far over it. So bytes are reserved
up front, converted to stored on success, and returned on failure. A crash between
reserve and commit leaks a reservation, which is the safe direction — it
under-permits rather than over-permits, and the reconciler can recover it.

Refund on delete
----------------
Commit is not the end of a document's accounting: deleting a document that reached
``complete`` has to give its stored bytes back, or every delete permanently shaves
the allowance (verified in dev: a 98-byte document uploaded, completed and deleted
left ``storedBytes`` and ``totalBytes`` 98 higher for good). Two ``DOC#`` markers
make that exact and exactly-once:

* ``committedBytes`` is stamped by :func:`record_commit` *before* the ``KB#``
  commit, and only while the row exists and is not ``deleting``. It is the amount
  a delete must return, and the true S3 size can differ from the declared
  ``sizeBytes``, so the row has to carry it.
* ``byteCapRefunded`` is claimed by :func:`refund_once`, which returns the amount
  once and 0 for every caller after it.

The ordering is what closes the race with a concurrent delete. The soft-delete
write and the ``committedBytes`` stamp hit the same item, so one of them is first:
stamp first, and the delete (which refunds after its own status write) sees the
stamp; delete first, and the stamp is refused and the settling path releases the
reservation instead of committing it. Both ``ADD`` writes commute, so a refund
landing before its commit still nets to zero.

Guards against driving a counter negative
-----------------------------------------
:func:`release` refuses to take ``reservedBytes`` below zero, and :func:`refund`
refuses to take ``storedBytes`` below zero. Either refusal means the caller is
settling bytes that were never counted — a document written while the knowledge
base was legacy, say — and letting it through would hand the owner allowance they
never had. The refusal leaves the counters too high, which is the safe direction.

Sizing
------
Size always comes from an S3 ``HEAD`` on the stored object, never from a
client-reported value: a client that under-reports its own size would defeat the
cap entirely. Bedrock's ``RawDataSize`` metric is deliberately **not** used for
enforcement — it returned 0 datapoints for a directly-ingested document during
evaluation and remains unconfirmed. Enforcing against a metric that is sometimes
absent would fail open.

Import weight
-------------
Module-level imports are stdlib only; ``boto3`` is function-local, so this module
can be imported into a size-constrained Lambda image for free.

    Migration is the largest byte-adding operation in the system and the only one

    "this needs an elevated tier" rather than a stack trace.

    ``snapshotReservedBytes``. Nothing ever commits this reservation — the bytes
    are already in S3, so there is no ingestion to settle it — and before that
    marker existed it stayed in ``reservedBytes`` for good: every migrated knowledge
    base in prod carried its whole corpus as a reservation and ``storedBytes=0``.
