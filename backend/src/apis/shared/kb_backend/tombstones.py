"""Tombstoned deletion sagas for managed knowledge bases.

Every delete here either completes or leaves a durable, retryable work item. That
is the whole requirement (Requirement 13), and it exists because a failed delete
of a managed knowledge base is not a crash — it is a **silent recurring bill**.

The ordering is the mechanism
-----------------------------
1. Write the Tombstone to DynamoDB.
2. *Then* call AWS.
3. Poll until AWS reports the resource genuinely absent.
4. *Only then* clear the Tombstone.

Reversing steps 1 and 2 looks equivalent and is not. A crash between the AWS call
and the database write leaves a half-deleted, still-billed resource that no record
points at, nothing alarms on, and no code will ever revisit. Written
tombstone-first, the same crash leaves a row that :func:`iter_tombstones` finds
(Requirement 13.8) and that a later pass can retry.

Clearing early is the same defect wearing the opposite hat: a tombstone cleared on
the strength of an *accepted* delete call describes a resource AWS may still be
holding, and holding it is what costs money. So :func:`clear_kb_tombstone` is
never called on the accept path — it is reachable only after
:func:`confirm_knowledge_base_absent` has returned true.

No TTL. Deliberately.
---------------------
A Tombstone is cleared by confirmed deletion or it stays. Attaching a TTL would
let DynamoDB quietly remove the evidence of a delete that never finished, which
recreates precisely the silent-leak class this module exists to close. The same
reasoning bans a TTL on the KB_Record itself (Requirement 13.6):
:func:`remove_kb_record` refuses outright unless the caller can show confirmation.

"Accepted" is not "gone"
------------------------
``DeleteKnowledgeBase`` returns ``status: DELETING`` and the resource lives on for
a measured **2-6 minutes**. There is no waiter, so absence is established by
polling ``ListKnowledgeBases`` until the identifier stops appearing
(Requirement 13.4), with a window comfortably past the observed worst case.

``DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL`` is a terminal *operator* state, not a completed delete
(Requirement 13.7). The dev account has contained one since 2025-11-24 that no
reconciler would ever have noticed. Observing it stops the poll, records the state
on the Tombstone, and leaves the Tombstone standing.

Why the tag filter costs a describe call per knowledge base
-----------------------------------------------------------
``ListKnowledgeBases`` has no tag-filter parameter and its summaries carry neither
``knowledgeBaseArn`` nor ``createdAt`` — verified against the packaged service
model, where ``KnowledgeBaseSummary`` is
``{knowledgeBaseId, name, description, status, updatedAt}``. Both of those are
needed: the ARN to read tags, and ``createdAt`` for the Reconciler's age gate. So
:func:`iter_project_knowledge_bases` pages the list and calls
``GetKnowledgeBase`` per entry. The alternative — synthesizing the ARN from the
region and account — trades a read call for a brittle string, and the caller here
is a daily job.

Import boundary
---------------
Module-level imports are stdlib plus this package's own stdlib-only modules;
``boto3`` and ``botocore`` are function-local. Nothing here imports
``apis.shared.assistants``, whose ``__init__`` pulls in the embeddings stack and
would blow the migration Lambda image budget. Enforced by
``tests/architecture/test_kb_backend_boundary.py``.

    The four steps run strictly in order, and the order is the guarantee:

    2. **Ask AWS.** ``ResourceNotFoundException`` is success, not failure — an
       earlier attempt got there, and the tombstone should still be cleared.
       With ``delete_data_source``, the data source is deleted first, best
       effort: a failure there is logged and the knowledge base delete goes
       ahead, because the knowledge base is what bills. If AWS refuses the
       knowledge base delete while its data source is still going away, the
       saga fails like any other refusal and its caller's retry finds the data
       source gone.
    3. **Confirm by polling.** The accepted call is ignored as evidence.
    4. **Clear the Tombstone**, and only now, optionally, the KB_Record.

    On any failure the Tombstone survives, annotated with the reason, and the
    exception propagates so the invocation fails and its retry or DLQ fires.
