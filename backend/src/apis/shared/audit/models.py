"""Audit record model — the durable answer to "who changed this?".

`admin_service` has emitted structured log records on every role mutation since
before delegated admin scopes existed. Those are log lines: no retention
guarantee, no before/after values, and nothing an admin can read from the
console. With a single superuser that was tolerable. Once admin power can be
*delegated* (`docs/specs/granular-admin-permissions.md`), "which admin granted
this, and when?" becomes a question the platform has to be able to answer.

**Scoped to what changed.** `before`/`after` carry only the fields a mutation
actually touched, not whole role snapshots. A role definition with a wildcard
tool grant and a full model list is large, and two copies of it per update would
push items toward the 400KB DynamoDB ceiling for no investigative gain — the
question is always "what changed", never "what did the whole record look like".

**Denied attempts are recorded too.** `outcome` exists because a delegated admin
who *tries* to escalate is more interesting than one who succeeds, and the
write-through guard (`RoleMutationForbidden`) is the only place that signal
exists.

    Deliberately a flat constant namespace rather than an Enum: these strings are

    Adding one is a code change with a test, which is the point.

    **There is no ``tool_granted`` / ``skill_granted`` action, on purpose.** The
    spec counted eight log emission points and expected eight record types, but
    four of them — `add_tool_to_role`, `remove_tool_from_role`, and the skill
    pair — are thin wrappers that build an ``AppRoleUpdate`` and delegate to
    `update_role`. So does the write-through path the tools/models/skills admin
    pages use (`ToolService._add_tool_to_role`). Emitting a record from the
    wrapper *and* from `update_role` would write two rows for one mutation and
    make every grant look like it happened twice. `ROLE_UPDATED` already carries
    an exact ``granted_tools`` / ``granted_skills`` before/after, which is the
    same information without the double-count.
