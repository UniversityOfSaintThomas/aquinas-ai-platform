"""Process-level feature flags resolved from environment variables.

These gate optional product surfaces per environment. Each flag documents
its own default. **New and in-development features default off** until a
deployment turns them on (only ``"true"`` enables; ``PROJECTS_ENABLED`` is the
current example). Finished features default on with a kill switch (the
``KB_SYNC_ENABLED`` pattern), and moving a feature there is a deliberate change.
The SPA has a matching compile-time switch per feature in
``frontend/ai.client/src/environments`` (see CLAUDE.MD "Feature Flags").
Each flag is read on every call (not cached at import) so that:

* import-time callers (conditional router mounting) and per-request callers
  observe the same value, and
* tests can flip a flag with ``monkeypatch.setenv`` (per-request paths) or a
  module reload (import-time paths) without a process restart.

    OFF** (the ``FINE_TUNING_ENABLED``-style opt-in): set
    ``FEEDBACK_EVAL_SAMPLING_ENABLED=true`` to turn it on.

    Off by default on purpose, not by caution: the judge is an AWS-managed
    evaluator that reads the conversation's spans — the full system prompt
    and every user message of the sampled session. The evaluations spike
    (``docs/specs/agentcore-evaluations-spike-findings.md`` §2) says to make
    that decision explicitly per environment rather than let it happen as a
    side effect, and the feedback spec's §8 puts conversation content behind
    a scope. Flipping this flag is that decision. The read surfaces (the
    queue list, the profile's judged aggregates) are not gated — they show
    numbers only and tolerate the absence of any judged row.

    ⚠️ Turning this on is not enough by itself. The inference-api image
    redacts Strands' message content in telemetry
    (``OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`` in ``Dockerfile.inference-api``), so
    the judge would read ``[REDACTED]`` in place of every message. An
    environment that opts in must also override that variable on the
    AgentCore Runtime, e.g. ``gen_ai_unredacted_attributes=gen_ai.*``. That
    records every conversation in the runtime log group, not just the
    sampled ones.
