"""The closed registry of delegated admin scopes.

An admin scope names one admin *feature area* — one router package under
``apis/app_api/admin/`` — that a system admin may delegate to another role via
``AppRole.granted_admin_scopes``.

Two properties of this module matter more than its contents:

**It is closed.** Scopes are defined here in code, never derived from a catalog
and never free text. The roles admin UI builds its ``grantedTools`` control from
the *tool catalog* with no free-text entry, so a capability id that is not a
catalog tool cannot be granted from the UI at all — only by hand-writing
DynamoDB items. That is precisely what made the short-lived ``skills`` and
``scheduled-runs`` capability gates inoperable (see the docstring on
``AppRoleService.resolve_user_permissions`` and the comment block at
``sidenav.html``). Admin scopes therefore get their own grant axis fed by this
registry, and PR-3 serves it to the SPA so the role form can render real
checkboxes.

**Some scopes are permanently non-delegable.** ``admin.roles`` is self-evident:
whoever can edit a role can grant themselves anything. ``admin.auth_providers``
is the non-obvious one — role resolution starts from JWT claims, so whoever
controls IdP attribute mapping controls which groups arrive and therefore which
AppRoles resolve. It is role administration by another route. Both stay
``system_admin``-only forever, enforced at the service layer by
``role_constraints.validate_admin_scopes`` so the rule holds for the REST API,
seed scripts, and future automation alike.

There is deliberately **no wildcard**. ``"*"`` is the idiom for the tool, model,
and skill axes; on this axis it is the shorthand that would quietly turn a role
into a superuser. Full admin is spelled ``system_admin``.
