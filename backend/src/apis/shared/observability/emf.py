"""CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) emission for prompt-cache metrics.

EMF turns a structured log line into CloudWatch metrics with no SDK calls,
no batching agent, and no extra IAM: CloudWatch Logs extracts any log event
whose message is a JSON object carrying the ``_aws.CloudWatchMetrics``
directive. Both compute surfaces already ship stdout to CloudWatch Logs
(inference-api via its AgentCore Runtime log group, app-api via ECS awslogs),
so a raw JSON line on stdout is all that's needed.

The line must be *exactly* the JSON object — a ``[INFO] logger-name:`` prefix
from the app's standard formatter would break extraction — so this module
uses a dedicated non-propagating logger with a message-only formatter.

    Metrics (no dimensions — fleet-wide sums are the alerting target; the
    per-model/per-session detail rides along as queryable log properties):

    - ``CacheReadTokens`` / ``CacheWriteTokens``: fleet cache traffic; their
      ratio is the cache-efficiency dashboard line.
    - ``AvoidableMiss``: count of calls classified ``miss_avoidable`` — the
      alarm target (a prefix-stability regression shows up as a step change).
    - ``PartialMiss``: count of calls classified ``partial_miss`` — a leading
      segment hit while the rest of the prefix was re-written against a live
      entry. Its own metric rather than a roll-in to ``AvoidableMiss`` so the
      existing alarm keeps its meaning and the two failure shapes (cold prefix
      vs. sliver-hit prefix) stay separable.
    - ``PartialMissUsd``: the subset of ``WastedUsd`` that ``PartialMiss``
      calls contributed.
    - ``WastedUsd``: dollars attributed to re-writes of already-cached prefix
      bytes — ``miss_avoidable`` **and** ``partial_miss``, since the dollars
      are identical and the north-star waste metric wants them together.
    - ``AgentSwitchMiss``: the subset of ``AvoidableMiss`` explained by the turn
      running on a different Agent than the one before it — an ``@``-mention
      (Marketplace D11) genuinely re-writes the prefix. Emitted as its own metric
      rather than as a dimension on ``AvoidableMiss`` so the alarm target stays a
      single fleet-wide sum: subtract it to get unexplained waste, which is the

      property, not a dimension, so per-Agent detail is queryable without
      multiplying metric streams.
