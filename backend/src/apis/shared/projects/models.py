"""Shared Projects domain models (docs/specs/shared-projects.md §3.1).

A Project is a composition: its harness (instructions, model, tools, knowledge)
is a hidden Agent record in ``rag-assistants`` with ``kind="project"``, and its
memory is a Memory Space (Phase 2). These models cover only what the
``{prefix}-projects`` table itself holds: the project's META row and its
email-keyed ``MEMBER#`` rows.

Ownership lives on META (``owner_id``), never as a member row — the same shape
as agents and memory spaces — so ``ProjectRole`` has three values while a
stored member can only be an editor or a viewer.
