"""Shared Projects service: permissions and orchestration (shared-projects §3.1, §5).

Every operation resolves the caller's project role first, through the same
:func:`~apis.shared.projects.access.resolve_project_role` the harness Agent uses,
so a project and its harness can never disagree about who may do what.

Roles:

  - **owner** (on META) — everything, including settings, archive/purge and transfer.
  - **editor** — edit the project; manage members (never the owner) while
    ``settings.editorsManageMembers`` is on, which is the default.
  - **viewer** — read.

A caller with no role gets "not found", never "forbidden": whether a project id
exists is not something a non-member is told.

An archived project is read-only. The only write it accepts is the owner
restoring it, and only an archived project can be purged — archive first, so a
delete is always two deliberate steps.
