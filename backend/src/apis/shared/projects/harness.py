"""The project's harness Agent, behind a narrow port.

A project's instructions, model, tools and knowledge live on an ordinary Agent
record marked ``kind="project"`` (shared-projects §2): the invocation path,
knowledge ingestion, retrieval and version diffs all key on an agent id, so a
project that *owns* an Agent inherits all of them.

The service talks to that Agent only through :class:`HarnessGateway`, for two
reasons. Tests can exercise project orchestration (including rollback) without
the assistants table. And deleting a harness for real needs the document and
sync-policy cleanup that lives in app-api, which ``apis.shared`` may not import —
so app-api injects a fuller gateway, while this default is enough to roll back a
create (a harness that just failed to attach has no documents yet).
