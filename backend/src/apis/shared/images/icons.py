"""Square-icon validation, normalization and object storage.

The owner-specific parts of an icon — what its S3 key looks like, what URL serves
it — belong to whatever owns the record (``apis.shared.assistants.icons`` for
Agents, ``apis.shared.models.model_icons`` for managed models). Everything below
is the part that must not be written twice.

Validation
----------
Everything a caller sends is untrusted, so the ``Content-Type`` header is ignored
and the format is sniffed from the bytes. Beyond the limits (PNG or JPEG,
≤ 400 KB, square), the image is **always re-encoded** even when it already
measures 512×512. That is not redundant work: re-encoding is what strips EXIF,
and someone uploading a phone photo as an icon would otherwise publish its GPS
coordinates to the whole institution.

Storage
-------
:class:`IconStore` is the generic put/get/delete against one bucket. Keys are
**content-addressed** by the caller, which buys two things: re-uploading the same
image is a no-op rather than a new object, and the digest doubles as the cache
version — a serve route hands it out as the ETag and read shapes hang it off
``?v=`` so an icon can be cached ``immutable`` and still change the moment a new
one is uploaded.
