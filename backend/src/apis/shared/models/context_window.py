"""Resolve a model's context window from the catalog, with an SDK fallback.

Issue #267, re-scoped. The original ask was "fall back to Strands' lookup
table when ``maxInputTokens`` is ``None``". That is half the fix, and taken
literally the other half is dangerous — see :func:`resolve_context_window`
for why **our** value wins whenever we have one.

**Why this exists.** ``maxInputTokens`` on a managed-model record governs two
things: the SPA's context badge, and — since #1125 — the *model-relative
compaction policy*, which cuts at ``window * COMPACTION_CEILING_RATIO``. A
stale row therefore does not merely mis-render a badge; it compacts
conversations early, paying a prefix re-write and a summarizer call sooner
than the model requires, and dropping context the model could have held.

That is not hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-21: the curated catalog had
Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.7 inheriting the 200,000 default while
both model cards publish **1M**, and dev's Claude Sonnet 5 row carried
200,000 against a catalog that declares 1,000,000 — three enabled models
cutting at 100k instead of 500k. Nothing detected it, because a plausible
number is indistinguishable from a correct one.

**The precedence, and the trap in reversing it.** Our catalog value wins.
It is operator-editable and can encode a *deliberate* cap that is not the
model's real window: ``maxInputTokens: 272_000`` on the hosted OpenAI rows
is load-bearing pricing (those models have a 1M window, but AWS bills input
at 2x and output at 1.5x above 272K, and ``CuratedModel`` holds one flat
rate per bucket). Preferring the SDK there would silently open the second
price card and under-charge every long turn. So the SDK table is a
**fallback for absence**, never an override — and a disagreement is
surfaced for a human rather than resolved in code.

    2. Strands' table when ours is absent — issue #267's actual ask.
    3. ``None`` — the caller reports "not tracked" and the compaction policy
