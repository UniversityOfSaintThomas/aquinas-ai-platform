"""Icons for managed models — the built-in logo slug and the uploaded override.

A model in the chat picker gets a left-aligned avatar, and there are two ways an
admin supplies one:

**A built-in logo slug** (``iconSlug``). The SPA already ships a light/dark SVG
pair per vendor under ``public/img/provider-logos/{slug}/``, which is what the
admin model catalog's quick-add cards render. Pointing at one of those is a
string on the record and costs no storage, no upload and no serve round trip —
and it stays a crisp, theme-correct vector, which a stored raster cannot be.
That is why this is not merely the fallback: for the vendors we ship, it is the
*better* answer.

**An uploaded image** (``iconKey`` → ``iconUrl``). For everything else — a
fine-tuned in-house model, a vendor we ship no logo for — the bytes go to S3 and
the record carries only the content-addressed key, exactly like Agent icons
(:mod:`apis.shared.assistants.icons`). Validation and storage are the shared
machinery in :mod:`apis.shared.images.icons`.

Precedence is upload → slug → (client-side) provider-name match → generic glyph.
An upload wins because it is the more specific, more deliberate act: an admin who
uploaded a file after choosing a slug meant the file.

Storage
-------
Objects land in the assistants asset bucket
(``S3_ASSISTANTS_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME`` → ``{prefix}-rag-documents``), under a
prefix of their own:

    models/{model_id}/icons/{sha256[:16]}.{png|jpg}

``model_id`` here is the record's UUID (``ManagedModel.id``), not the Bedrock
model identifier — the latter contains ``:`` and ``.`` and changes when an admin
re-points a record at a new model version, which would orphan the object.
