"""TTL + single-flight cache for tenant-global config item lists.

The SPA's first load reads several catalogs that are the *same for everyone*
on the deployment — the model catalog, the tool catalog, the system-prompt
list, the connector list. Each read was an uncached DynamoDB scan (or, for
connectors, a GSI query) that also re-parsed every row. A classroom signing in
together ran one of each per student.

Two properties matter here, and the second is the one that actually shows up
under a burst:

**TTL.** A catalog changes when an admin edits it, which is rare, so a short
window collapses ~all of the reads.

**Single flight.** A cold cache with 300 simultaneous requests would otherwise
produce 300 concurrent scans — the stampede lands at exactly the moment the
burst does, which is the case this exists to prevent. One loader runs per key;
everyone else awaits it.

## What is cached: raw items, not parsed objects

Entries hold the **raw DynamoDB items**, and callers re-parse on every read.

That is deliberate, and it is not a missed optimization. Callers mutate the
objects these lists produce: ``hydrate_model_roles`` documents itself as
"models to hydrate (mutated in place and returned)" and writes
``allowed_app_roles`` onto each model, and ``list_tools_with_roles`` does the
same to ``ToolDefinition``. Caching parsed objects would hand every caller a
reference to one shared instance, so an admin opening the models page would
write derived, display-only role fields onto the objects subsequently served
to every user — and per CLAUDE.md ``allowedAppRoles`` is precisely the field
that must never be mistaken for a grant.

Re-parsing costs microseconds of CPU against a network round trip of ~50-100ms
(measured medians: ``/models`` 46ms, ``/tools/`` 91ms), so the saving that
matters is kept while the shared-mutable-state class of bug is designed out
entirely — including for callers added later, who cannot be audited in advance.

The list itself is shallow-copied on read so a caller cannot append to or sort
the cached list. The item dicts are shared; parsers treat them as read-only.

## Scope: per process, like the rest of our caches

This is an in-process cache, matching ``AppRoleCache`` and the roles-version
watermark. A write invalidates only the task that served it, so a second ECS
task can serve a stale catalog until its entry expires. That is why the default
TTL is short (60s) rather than the 5-10 minutes ``AppRoleCache`` uses for
authorization data: an admin edit should not appear to "not take" for minutes.
Bounding it to a minute keeps the burst win (a classroom arrives inside a few
seconds) while keeping admin feedback close to immediate.
