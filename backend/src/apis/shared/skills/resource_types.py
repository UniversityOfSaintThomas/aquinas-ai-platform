"""MIME policy for skill bundle files — the one place that decides what a
skill resource may be and how it is allowed to leave the API.

Why this module exists
----------------------
A skill resource is **content one user uploads and another user's browser
downloads**, and app-api is served from the *same origin* as the Angular SPA
(the CloudFront ``/api/*`` behavior). That makes an uploaded file a potential
top-level document on the SPA's own origin: if the response says
``Content-Type: text/html`` and ``Content-Disposition: inline``, the browser
parses it as a document and any ``<script>`` in it runs with the *viewer's*
session — the viewer's cookies, the viewer's CSRF token, the viewer's
privileges. An unprivileged author uploading ``payload.html`` and getting an
admin to open it is full privilege escalation, not a display bug.

Two controls, applied at both ends, so neither one is load-bearing alone:

**Write side** — :func:`resolve_upload_content_type` derives the stored media
type from the *filename extension against an allowlist* and **ignores the
client-supplied multipart ``Content-Type`` entirely**. A caller cannot label
their bytes, and cannot upload an extension that is not on the list. This is
the same posture the agent-icon route already takes (sniff the bytes, ignore
the header) — see ``apis.shared.assistants.icons``.

**Read side** — :func:`safe_download_content_type` and
:func:`resource_download_headers` re-derive the served type from the filename
at *serve* time and force ``attachment`` + ``nosniff`` + a no-op CSP. This is
what protects rows written before the allowlist existed: a stored
``content_type`` of ``text/html`` is never reflected back to a browser, so
already-uploaded payloads are neutralized without a data migration.

No entry in the allowlist is a media type a browser will execute as script in
the page's origin. Notably absent:

* ``.html`` / ``.htm`` / ``.xhtml`` / ``.xml`` / ``.svg`` — parsed as documents
  and can carry inline script. SVG is on this list for the same reason as HTML:
  ``image/svg+xml`` navigated to top-level is a scriptable document.
* ``.js`` / ``.mjs`` / ``.css`` as *active* types — the extensions are allowed
  (a skill may legitimately ship example code) but map to ``text/plain``, so
  the bytes are readable and inert. This matches spec D5: ``script`` resources
  are stored, listed, and never executed.

Both tiers (admin catalog and user-authored "My Skills") funnel their uploads
through ``SkillCatalogService.add_resource``, so applying the policy there
covers both. Enforced by tests/apis/app_api/skills/test_skill_resource_mime.py.

# Response headers that make a skill-resource body undownloadable *as a
# document*, whatever its bytes or its stored type claim to be:
#
#   nosniff  — the browser must honor our Content-Type and must not re-sniff
#              ``<html>`` bytes into ``text/html``.
#   CSP      — ``default-src 'none'`` + ``sandbox`` means that even if a
#              browser did treat the body as a document, it has no script,
#              no fetch, and an opaque origin, so it cannot touch the SPA's
#              session. ``frame-ancestors 'none'`` keeps it out of frames.
#   no-store — these are per-user private files behind a session cookie;
#              nothing on the path (CloudFront included) should retain them.
#
# Which of these the browser actually receives depends on how the response is
# reached, and BOTH paths are real:
#
#   Direct ALB / local dev — the ALB is `internetFacing: true`, and a
#     localhost:4200 SPA talks to the dev backend directly. There is no edge
#     policy on this path, so this dict IS the browser's only CSP and
#     ``sandbox`` is the live control it claims to be.
#
#   Behind CloudFront — the `/api/*` behavior's `ApiResponseHeadersPolicy`
#     (infrastructure/lib/constructs/spa/spa-distribution-construct.ts) sets
#     its CSP with `override: true`, so it REPLACES this header and the
#     browser sees `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` without
#     ``; sandbox``. That is deliberate, not a regression: the edge policy is
#     an origin-wide backstop covering every `/api/*` response — attachment
#     bodies and the top-level OAuth login navigation included — where a bare
#     `sandbox` would force an opaque origin for no real gain, because
#     `default-src 'none'` already blocks every script that an opaque origin
#     would be protecting the session from. `infrastructure/test/
#     api-security-headers.test.ts` pins that string and asserts the omission
#     is intentional, so the two layers cannot drift silently.
#
# Do not "fix" the difference by dropping `override: true`: that would turn
# the edge backstop into a mere default, letting any future route, middleware
# or error handler define the CSP for the whole origin.
