    #
    # ⚠️ **LEGACY as of 2026-09-14 — the current SPA never sends this.** A mention now
    # means "talk to this Agent": on an empty thread it binds like a launch, and in a
    # thread that already has messages the SPA opens a *new* conversation with the Agent
    # instead of sending a borrowed turn. The one-turn borrow this flag requests failed
    # silently — the next message lost the Agent's tools, skills and model with no signal
    # to the user or the model — and prod said nobody used what it was protecting (247 of
    # 247 mentions started their conversation). See D11 in docs/specs/agent-marketplace.md.
    #
    # Still honoured for clients that predate the change, with one correction:
    # `binds_conversation` now BINDS such a mention when the thread is empty, so a stale
    # tab lands in the same place a current one does. A mention into a thread that already
    # has messages keeps the old borrow semantics — that path is unreachable from the
    # current SPA, and changing it for old clients would annex their conversation.
    #
    # A borrowed turn skips the bind-once-per-session validation and skips writing
    # `preferences.assistant_id`. Everything else — access check, RAG, binding resolution,
    # memory injection — is identical to a bound turn, because the same Agent is running
    # with the same governance.

    #    be testing something approval is not going to publish.
    # 2. The PRIVATE access check is bypassed, because a PRIVATE Agent can be — and often
    #    is — sitting in the review queue, and `get_assistant_with_access_check` refuses a
    #    non-owner outright on one.
    #
    # ⚠️ Unlike `agent_mention`, this is NOT merely a claim about intent, so it cannot be
    # treated like one: it widens access. The route re-checks `admin.marketplace` against
    # the caller's own roles before honoring it, and a caller without the scope gets a 403
