"""Agent Designer Phase 3 — run-time binding resolution (the Harness side).

At invocation the Harness re-resolves an Agent's ``modelConfig`` + ``bindings`` against
the **invoking** user (D5), not the author — an Agent is shared but its capabilities are
gated per user. v1 policy is **block-with-message**: if the invoker lacks a required
capability the turn raises ``AgentBindingBlockedError`` and the route streams a
conversational error (SSE ``stream_error``) rather than silently downgrading.

This module lives in inference-api and may import only ``apis.shared`` (never
``apis.app_api`` — the design-time ``binding_validation`` there is a different concern and
would break the import boundary). It reuses the harness's existing per-primitive access
checks; it invents no new RBAC (D4).

Phase 3 lands incrementally:
- ``modelConfig`` → ``model_override``, reusing the exact ``AppRoleService.can_access_model``
  gate the harness already enforces (R2). Absent ``modelConfig`` ⇒ no override ⇒ today's
  model-resolution chain is untouched.
- ``memory_space`` bindings → index injection + ``memory_*`` tools.
- ``tool`` bindings → the effective tool allowlist (**replace**, mirroring the model
  override): when an Agent binds tools they *are* its toolset, re-resolved per invoker via
  the same ``AppRoleService.can_access_tool`` gate; a bound tool the invoker lacks blocks the
  turn (D5). Absent tool bindings ⇒ the request's ``enabled_tools`` drive the turn as today.
  A ref may be *scoped* (``toolId::mcpToolName``) to bind a subset of an MCP server's tools
  rather than all of them; the scoped id rides through to the runtime, where
  ``collect_tool_name_filters`` turns it into that server's ``allowed_tool_names``.
- ``skill`` bindings → the effective skill set (**replace**, same shape as tools): when an
  Agent binds skills they *are* the turn's skills, re-resolved per invoker via the
  invoke-through predicate (§6/D7, ``resolve_invocable_skill_ids``); a bound skill the
  invoker lacks — or the skills feature being disabled in this environment — blocks the
  turn (D5). The caller hands the result to ChatAgent as ``accessible_skill_ids``, which
  is what mounts the ``AgentSkills`` disclosure plugin. Absent skill bindings ⇒ the
  request's ``enabled_skills`` drive the turn as today.
- ``knowledge_base`` stays with the existing RAG path.

**Degrade with notice — a Shared Project's harness only** (shared-projects §9.6). A project
can have 200 members, and blocking the whole turn because one member lacks one bound tool
would make the project unusable to them. With ``degrade=True`` a missing capability is
dropped instead of raised: unavailable tools and skills are left out, an unavailable model
falls through to the invoker's default, an unreachable memory binding is skipped, and
each drop is recorded in ``plan.unavailable`` for the route to surface as an
``agent_notice``. Ordinary shared agents keep block-with-message (D5) unchanged. Nothing
about a drop enters the prompt — the notice is for the person, not the model.
