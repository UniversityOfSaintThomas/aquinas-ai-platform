    Create a cache key for agent instances.

    `memory_binding` is ``memory_binding_digest`` of what the turn's memory
    tools close over, or "" when there are none. For an Agent's binding that is
    the space id, name and access: the write tool exists only for
    ``readwrite``, and the name is in the tools' result messages (their specs
    are constant). For a project harness it is the project and its two space
    ids (Shared Projects 2.4b). Either way the tools read the spaces live on
    every call, so they are described once the key carries this. Empty string
    without memory tools, so those turns key exactly as before apart from the
    constant extra element.

    `memory_context` is the rendered Memory-Space block sent after the system
    prompt (Shared Projects 2.2). It used to be part of `system_prompt`, so it
    is folded into the same prompt hash rather than adding an element; a turn
    without memory hashes exactly as before.

    `assistant_id` is the assistant (RAG corpus) the turn ran against. The
    spreadsheet-analysis builders close over it, so without it in the key a
    cached agent could answer a later turn against the wrong corpus — which
    is why that family bypassed the cache until the key carried it. Empty
    string when no assistant is attached, so keys for assistant-less turns are
    byte-identical to the pre-field ones.

    `document_tools` is whether the turn built the session-state-gated
    ``document_read`` tool (the session has a readable attachment). It is not
    in `enabled_tools`, so without this element an agent cached before the
    first upload would be served — without the tool — to every turn after it.
    The gate is monotonic in practice (files stay once uploaded), so the key
    flips at most once per session, on the attach turn, when restored history
    carries no document yet to lose.

    `freshness_hash` is a short digest of the enabled tools' current
    `updated_at` values (see `freshness.get_freshness_hash`). When an
    admin edits a tool's config, the hash changes and the cache misses,
    so the next turn builds a fresh agent with the new config.

    `skills_hash` is the skills analog: a digest of the user's resolved
    accessible skill ids AND their `updated_at` values (skills/freshness).
    A skill turn's `<available_skills>` disclosure is derived from the user's
    granted skills, which `enabled_tools` does not capture — so without this an
    edit to a granted skill (or a role grant change) would serve a stale agent.
    Empty for chat turns with no skills, so the default path is unaffected.

    The cache key varies with an agent's *configuration* — system prompt, tools,
    model, skills — and that is correct: those genuinely need different ``Agent``
    objects. The **conversation** is not configuration. One session is one
    conversation, whichever agent happens to run a given turn.

    Without this, an `@`-mention (Marketplace D11) forks the thread. The mention
    turn misses the cache and builds a second agent, which restores history and
    looks fine; the next plain turn reverts the key and cache-*hits* the original
    instance, whose in-memory list still ends before the mention. ``initialize()``
    never re-runs on a hit, so the stale list wins and the model answers "NOT IN
    HISTORY" about a turn the user can see on screen (issue #741).

    ⚠️ The list is shared **by reference, deliberately**. Copying would fix only
    the direction that already works — the miss. The turn that goes stale is a
    cache hit, where nothing runs at all and there is no opportunity to copy
    anything. Aliasing is what makes the mention turn's appends visible to the
    instance the *next* turn will hit. This holds because every site that rebinds
    ``agent.messages`` lives inside ``TurnBasedSessionManager.initialize()``
    (document stripping, content-block sanitizing, compaction slicing, pairing
    repair) and so runs before we get here; after construction the list is only
    appended to — or, for the pending-cut apply at the head of a turn, sliced
    **in place** by slice assignment (``messages[:] = ...``), which keeps the
    alias. A future compaction that rebinds mid-life would silently break
    the alias — ``test_second_cache_key_for_a_session_shares_the_conversation``
    is what catches that.

    Re-restoring on a stale hit was the alternative and is worse: restored history
    passes through the sanitizers and pairing repair while accumulated history does
    not, so the same conversation can serialize differently depending on the path
    that produced it — a prefix-byte change on an arbitrary turn, which is exactly
    what the prompt-cache contract forbids. Aliasing never re-serializes anything.

    Safe against concurrent turns because the single-flight session lease admits
    one turn per session at a time. Cross-replica divergence is not our problem
    either way — separate processes share no cache — but the length guard below
    keeps us from *losing* history if a live instance ever trails what was

# System prompt for title generation optimized for Nova Micro
TITLE_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a precise title generator for conversational AI sessions.

Your role is to analyze a user's initial message and create a concise, descriptive title that captures the essence of their intent or question.

Guidelines:
- Maximum 50 characters (strictly enforced)
- Use clear, specific language
- Avoid generic phrases like "Question about" or "Help with"
- Capture the core topic or action
- Use title case (capitalize major words)
- No quotes, periods, or special formatting

Examples:
Input: "Can you help me write a Python script to parse CSV files and extract specific columns?"
Output: Python CSV Parser Script

Input: "I need to understand how React hooks work, specifically useState and useEffect"
Output: React Hooks: useState & useEffect

Input: "What's the weather like in Tokyo right now?"
Output: Tokyo Weather Query

Input: "Help me debug this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
Output: Debug TypeError Map Error

Focus on being informative and scannable. The title should allow users to quickly identify this conversation in a list."""
