    it, so the main turn and the MCP App dispatch compute the same effective
    list and therefore the same agent-cache slot.

    ``agent_bound_tools`` is whether an Agent's ``tool`` bindings are driving
    this turn. **When they are, nothing is pinned.** An Agent that binds tools
    owns its toolset the way ``modelConfig`` owns the model, and unioning into
    it would override the author's explicit scoping.

    ⚠️ The exemption is "the Agent binds its own toolset", NOT "the turn ran an
    Agent". ``_resolve_tools`` returns ``None`` — so ``agent_bound_tools`` is
    False — for an Agent with no ``tool`` bindings, and such a turn falls
    through to the user's picker and **does** get the pinned set. That is
    deliberate: a template-derived Agent starts with empty ``bindings``
    (``agent_templates/seed.py``), and exempting it would make always-on
    opt-out-by-construction — anyone could shed a pinned tool with a trivial
    unbound Agent. See docs/specs/admin-always-on-tools.md §7 D4.

    This is a deliberate divergence from the attachment auto-enable above,
    which applies to the effective list and so does reach Agent-bound turns:
    that one serves the *user's* intent (they attached the file), this one
    serves the *admin's* — and the Agent author is exercising admin intent too.

    **System tools are the exception to the exception.** A ``system`` tool
    (platform-shipped plumbing such as ``whoami``/``get_my_quota``) is part of
    the app, not the user's picker and not the admin's per-deployment pin, so it
    is unioned in on EVERY turn — including Agent-bound ones. An Agent author
    scopes the *user-facing* toolset; they do not get to remove the platform's
    own self-service capabilities. See .kiro/specs/platform-self-service/design.md.
