"""Born-managed: provisioning stacked onto the first document upload.

Feature: managed-kb-migration, ``MANAGED_KB_NEW_DEFAULT`` (rollout ladder step 2).
Spec: ``.kiro/specs/managed-kb-migration/born-managed-provision-then-ingest.md``.

Four failure modes are what this file is actually for. None of them raises an
error on its own, which is why each needs a test that fails when the guard is
removed:

**1. Double indexing.** The legacy pipeline skips a document only when the record
already resolves to ``managed``. Declare the engine after the first upload instead
of before it and that document is indexed on legacy *and* on managed, with two
writers racing over one ``status`` field.

**2. A dead-lettered first document.** The S3 event fires in seconds;
``CreateKnowledgeBase`` takes minutes. Lambda's async retry is capped at 2
attempts, so a consumer that raises "not provisioned" burns the whole window and
dead-letters — the §5.37 shape, where the bytes are fine and the document is
invisible forever.

**3. A stranded agent.** Managed intent with no knowledge base is a dead end in
both directions: legacy skips it because the record says managed, managed cannot
serve because there is nothing to serve from. Every provisioning failure must
REMOVE ``retrievalEngine``, not merely stop.

**4. A rollout ladder that skipped a rung.** Born-managed is served by the
migration dispatcher, so gating that dispatcher on ``MANAGED_KB_MIGRATION_ENABLED``
would make step 2 either useless alone or a back door that migrates the existing
fleet. Each work state is gated on its own flag, and both halves are asserted.
