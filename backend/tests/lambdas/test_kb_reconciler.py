"""Daily reconciler — the join, the age gate, and the disarmed default.

Feature: managed-kb-migration, task 10.3.
Requirements: 24.4, 14.1-14.8, 19.7, 19.8.

Three assertions here are the reason the file exists, and each guards a mistake
that a passing test suite would otherwise hide:

**The age gate reads AWS's ``createdAt``, never discovery time.** Asserted from
both ends. An orphan that AWS says is eight days old is deletable on the *very
first* run that ever sees it — an implementation that started a 24-hour clock at
discovery would leave it, and would then leave it again after any reconciler
outage. And a knowledge base AWS says is 30 seconds old is left alone even though
it is equally newly discovered, because that one is an in-flight create.

**Record-only marks and never deletes.** A KB_Record whose AWS knowledge base has
gone means the *vectors* are gone. The uploaded bytes are still in S3 and the
``DOC#`` rows still describe them, so the corpus rebuilds on the next ingest and
the owner re-uploads nothing. The record is the only pointer to that corpus, so
deleting it is the single action in this module that would lose user data.

**Report-only really is a no-op.** The shipped mode logs intended deletions and
issues none, and the arming flag treats an empty string as off — an unset GitHub
Actions variable expands to ``""``.

No test contacts AWS. DynamoDB is moto; ``bedrock-agent`` is a stub
(Requirement 24.11).
