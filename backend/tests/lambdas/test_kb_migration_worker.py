"""
Migration dispatcher and worker: bounded, leased, and safe to interrupt.

Requirements 15, 16, 19.6. The tests here concentrate on the things that are
invisible when they break:

* The dispatcher **no-ops when the flag is off**, and "off" includes present but
  empty. This is the reconciler-arming defect's shape, and it is worth re-testing
  per component because each one reads its own flag.
* The worker dispatches on the **record's** state, never the event's. An event
  field that could select `promote` would let a hand-crafted invocation cut a
  knowledge base over without it ever verifying.
* A document deleted mid-migration is **not resurrected** — asserted by deleting it
  between the snapshot and the ingest, which is the only window where the bug
  exists.
* Catch-up **converges on quiet**, not after a fixed number of passes.
* Concurrent promotion yields **one winner**, which is a property of the
  conditional write rather than of any locking here.
