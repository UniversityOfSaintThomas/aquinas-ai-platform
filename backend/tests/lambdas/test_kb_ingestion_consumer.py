"""Routing exclusivity for the managed-KB ingestion consumer.

Feature: managed-kb-migration, task 9.2.

The failure this file exists to prevent is **double indexing**. The legacy pipeline
is driven by its own pre-existing S3 notification on the same bucket, so for a legacy
document the correct behaviour of this consumer is to do nothing whatsoever. If it
ingested as well, the same bytes would be embedded twice: two sets of vectors,
doubled ingestion cost, and duplicate chunks competing inside one result list. None
of that raises an error, which is exactly why it needs a test.

The routing is therefore deliberately asymmetric, and both halves are asserted:
legacy must ingest NOTHING here, managed must ingest here and NOT fall back.

    That poll window was sized against the INDEXED -> retrievable gap
    (0.75-1.03 s), while it actually had to cover ingest -> INDEXED -> retrievable,
    which the §5.1 benchmark measured at 37-264 s for PDFs.

    Each of the three redeliveries then RE-INGESTED, discarding progress and
    restarting the clock. The document reached INDEXED 54 s after the final attempt
    was dead-lettered, leaving a fully retrievable document parked at `uploading`
    with nothing left to reconcile it — the legacy pipeline no longer writes status
