"""Every admin route is governed by exactly one known admin scope.

The regression this exists to prevent: someone adds a route under ``/admin``
and forgets the scope, leaving it reachable by *every* delegated admin. That
failure is silent — the route works, the tests pass, and the hole is only
visible by reading the dependency.

So rather than trusting review, this walks the mounted admin router and asserts
every route resolves to either a registry scope or one of the two explicitly
non-delegable modules.

See ``docs/specs/granular-admin-permissions.md`` §6.3.
