"""
Parity contract tests: the rules hold on the managed path, not just legacy.

Requirement 3 says a migrated knowledge base must behave exactly as it did
before, parser quality aside. Four properties carry that promise, and all four
are owned by the **facade** in ``rag_service`` rather than by either adapter —
which is the point of these tests. A rule implemented inside the legacy adapter
would be a rule the managed adapter silently lacks, and the symptom would be a
quality difference that looks like the engine swap's fault.

The managed backend itself is task 8.3. These tests use a protocol-conforming
stand-in, which is sufficient and in fact preferable: what is under test is
whether the *facade* applies ``top_k``, the status filter, the 2,000-character
cap and the 500-character citation clip to whatever comes back across the seam.
A stand-in proves that without letting Bedrock's wire format into the assertion.
