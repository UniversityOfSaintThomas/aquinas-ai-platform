"""Property-based tests for byte cap accounting.

Feature: managed-kb-migration

**Property 5: the cap is never exceeded, under any interleaving.**

Managed storage costs $5.00/GB-month, so the cap is the only thing standing between
the measured ~$169/month fleet cost and the ~$15,000/month that unbounded uploads
would permit. "Usually holds" is not a cap.

The property is asserted against real DynamoDB semantics (via moto) rather than
against a Python model of them, because the entire correctness argument rests on
one specific database behaviour: that a conditional ``ADD`` is atomic. A test that
simulated the arithmetic in Python would pass just as happily against a
read-then-write implementation, which is precisely the broken version.

Why the accumulator matters
---------------------------
DynamoDB cannot do arithmetic inside a condition expression — verified, it fails to
parse. So the guard compares a single ``totalBytes`` accumulator against a literal
computed before the call (``cap - n``). The invariant
``totalBytes == storedBytes + reservedBytes`` is what makes that sound, and several
tests below assert it directly rather than only checking the total.

Validates: Requirements 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 24.7.
