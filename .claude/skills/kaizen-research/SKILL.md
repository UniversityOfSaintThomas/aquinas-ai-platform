description: Weekly Friday early-morning external + internal scan for emerging functionality, agentic trends, tools, and feature/UX improvements in the AgentCore Public Stack repo. Tracks AWS Bedrock + AgentCore announcements, Strands Agents releases, FastMCP (used by externally hosted MCP servers), the aws-samples/sample-strands-agent-with-agentcore reference repo, the MCP ecosystem (including MCP Apps + extensions), frontier model announcements, agent-harness patterns (including opencode (anomalyco/opencode) as an open-source coding-agent harness reference scanned through tooling, cost-effectiveness, and context-engineering lenses — releases-first, light touch), agentic UI/UX patterns (MCP Apps, Vercel AI SDK, assistant-ui, NN/g AI research, Linear/Cursor/Anthropic product blogs), and LibreChat as a parallel open-source agentic-platform reference (releases-first, light touch). Audits internal signals (recent commits, open PRs, CI failures, version-pin lag, dormant skills). Outputs a dated research doc + queues ideas in `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md` for that same morning's `kaizen-review-prep` (runs ~4 hours later) to rank into decisions. Opens a PR into `develop`. **Out of scope**: security advisories / Dependabot / CodeQL — those have dedicated tooling and don't need a weekly kaizen lens. Triggers: "kaizen research", "weekly research scan", "external scan", "what should we look at this week".

# Kaizen Research

Friday early morning. The "what's the rest of the world learning that we should consider, and what's our own week telling us?" scan. Pairs with `kaizen-review-prep` which runs ~2 hours later the same morning and ranks this skill's output into a decision agenda — both docs ready before Phil sits down to review Friday morning.

## Philosophy

- **Subtraction first.** Every research run should propose at least as many things to *remove or simplify* as to add. A smaller stack you trust beats a bigger one you route around. **Subtraction explicitly includes replacing custom code with library-native equivalents** — when an upstream release (Strands, AgentCore SDK, FastMCP, MCP, etc.) ships a capability we'd already built or filed an issue for, the win is closing our version and adopting upstream. Example: the 2026-05-10 bootstrap run found that Strands v1.37/v1.38 silently closed our open issues #266 and #267 — the codebase surface area shrinks even though we "added" a dep bump.
- **Dual lens — impact + capability-unlock.** Evaluate every upstream feature through *two* lenses, not one: (a) **impact on existing code** (does it change, simplify, or obsolete something we already have?) and (b) **capability unlock** (what *new* product capability, UX pattern, or enhancement does this make possible that we couldn't easily do before?). Subtraction-first still applies to the first lens. But capability-unlock items — features that enable net-new product surface — must be evaluated on their strategic merit, *not* hedged into "replaces future glue we haven't written." Example: the 2026-05-10 AgentCore Runtime BYO filesystem was first framed only as "could replace future filesystem-staging glue" — under-weighting the real story (code-interpreter sandboxes, cross-session uploads, shared skill hot-swap, persistent vector indexes). A dep-bump's win is usually subtraction; a *new* platform primitive's win is usually capability unlock. Don't mis-classify.
- **Subagent fan-out.** External sources are independent — fan them out to parallel subagents and synthesize. Keeps the main context clean and runs faster.
- **Web budget soft cap.** Target ≤50 web requests. If a source is exhausted, unreachable, or rate-limited, list it as "not scanned this week" — don't skip silently. Going modestly over the cap (say, to 60) is fine if the extra requests are surfacing real signal; document the overage in the Web Budget block. Don't pad — if 30 requests covered every source meaningfully, stop at 30.
- **Cite everything.** Every external claim gets a URL + access date in the Sources Scanned appendix. Web findings rot fast and you'll re-read them next week.
- **No edits outside `docs/kaizen/`.** This skill writes a dated research doc and updates `review-queue.md`. It never touches `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infrastructure/`, `CLAUDE.md`, or skill files.

## When to run

Friday early morning (~6am MT). `kaizen-review-prep` runs ~4 hours later (~10am MT), a gap sized to this scan's own runtime (2h18m on 2026-09-11) rather than to the 2 hours the two skills used to claim — on 2026-09-18 the prep ran 18 minutes after this scan started and produced a review with no research doc. Both docs are waiting when Phil sits down Friday late morning; he reviews, picks 1–3 to ship over the coming week, and the *outcomes* of those picks are what review-prep reads the following Friday.

2a. **Prompt caching across providers — standing watch (added 2026-09-05)**

   We carry custom code that exists only because Strands' caching support is
   Bedrock/Anthropic-shaped. Upstream is converging on a provider-agnostic
   `CacheConfig`, so this is *mostly* a **subtraction** item: each upstream landing
   should delete code here, not add it. Check every run, and check it for *all*
   cacheable families — Anthropic, OpenAI/GPT, and any newly cacheable model — not
   just the one that prompted this.

   ⚠️ **Amended 2026-09-11: it is not subtraction-only, and the second half is now
   the more valuable one.** Two kinds of drift matter, and only the first deletes
   code. **(i) Convergence** — upstream absorbs something we hand-roll; propose the
   swap. **(ii) Coverage** — a Bedrock family gains prompt caching that *neither*
   we nor upstream will use, because both gate on the same `_cache_strategy`
   string test for `"claude"`/`"anthropic"`. Measured that day: **Nova Micro
   accepts an explicit system cachePoint and honors it** (7,203 input tokens → 2,
   7,201 cache-written) while `bedrock_cache_points_supported()` refuses it. That
   is caching left on the floor, it grows every time AWS ships a cacheable model,
   and no test can catch it — a string predicate keeps answering the same thing
   while the platform moves underneath it. Coverage findings are **additions**;
   file them anyway.

   Our carried code, and what would retire it:

   | Ours | Retired by |
   |---|---|
   | `usage_normalization.py` — maps `cache_write_tokens`, which Strands drops | [harness-sdk#4193](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/4193) (ours) — **merged 2026-09-25, after `python/v1.57.1`**; retires on the first release that contains it |
   | `usage_normalization.py` — disjointness shim for OpenAI's inclusive `input_tokens` | **Not retired by upstream — see the #4618 warning below.** [#3546](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/issues/3546) closes once [#4617](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/pull/4617) merges; its successor [#4618](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/issues/4618) picks the *other* convention |
   | `build_prompt_cache_key()` in `bedrock_responses.py` | `strands/models/_openai_cache.py::apply_cache_config` — **already on upstream main**, maps `CacheConfig.cache_key` → `prompt_cache_key`. Adopt on the next pin bump. |
   | `apply_explicit_prompt_cache()` (breakpoints) | No upstream equivalent yet — `apply_cache_config` emits no `prompt_cache_breakpoint`. Ours is OFF by default (measured 57% worse); don't re-enable without re-running the probe. |
   | `cache_ttl_seconds_for()` in `observability/prompt_cache.py` | A model-derived TTL upstream. Note `apply_cache_config` maps ttl to `prompt_cache_retention` (`in_memory`/`24h`), *not* GPT-5.6's `prompt_cache_options.ttl: "30m"` — so these are not yet the same concept. |
   | `bedrock_cache_points_supported()` + the hand-placed system cachePoint | **NOTHING upstream can retire this — settled by measurement 2026-09-11, do not re-propose.** `format_request` copies `system_prompt_content` verbatim and `_apply_system_cache_ttl` never removes a point, so the block reaches Bedrock, which answers `AccessDeniedException` on a model that can't cache. The rejection is Bedrock's, not the SDK's. Only its `tools_ttl` half is redundant (upstream applies the same test at `bedrock.py:579`). |

   ⚠️ **harness-sdk#4618 (tracked from 2026-09-25) inverts our convention. It is a
   pin-bump hazard, not a subtraction.** #4618 proposes one canonical `Usage`
   convention, semconv **subset**: `inputTokens` *includes* cache reads and
   writes, and `totalTokens == inputTokens + outputTokens`. It enforces this at
   the provider boundary, so the **Bedrock and Anthropic adapters would fold
   cache tokens into `inputTokens`**. Everything we own assumes the opposite,
   the disjoint Converse convention: `CostCalculator.calculate_message_cost`,
   the context-size sum in `stream_coordinator.py`, `observability/prompt_cache.py`
   and `prefix_tokens.py`, and the `C#` metadata rows. The day a pin containing
   it lands, every cached Bedrock token is billed twice (input rate *plus* the
   cache rate), and a cache write is billed at the input rate plus the 1.25×
   premium. On our default path that is most of the prompt. Nothing errors,
   and the only symptom is cost and quota inflating on cache hits.
   `normalize_usage()` would have to learn to subtract for Bedrock too. Its
   docstring's "leaves Bedrock usage untouched" would then be the bug. Direct
   boto3 Converse callers (e.g. `app_api/chat/converse_routes.py`) keep the
   disjoint shape, so two conventions would coexist inside our own code. The
   proposal also adds a reasoning-token field (a *subset* of `outputTokens`,
   so it is a breakdown, never an extra charge). Status at filing: open,
   "warrants a short design doc before implementation", no PR yet.

   Each run, answer:
   - **#4618:** did a design doc, a PR, or a release note land? Does any adapter
     in the pinned version (or the candidate bump) now fold cache tokens into
     `inputTokens`? Check Bedrock specifically:
     `strands/models/bedrock.py` usage handling, and whether `_total_prompt_tokens`
     still exists (its deletion is the tell that the flip shipped). If it
     shipped, **the bump PR must carry the matching `normalize_usage` change**,
     plus a live check that one cached Bedrock call prices identically before
     and after. Queue it as a blocking gate on the bump, not an idea.
   - Does the pinned Strands version now ship `_openai_cache.py` / a `CacheConfig`
     that covers a provider we hand-roll? If so, propose the swap and say which of
     our modules shrinks.
   - Did `CacheConfig` gain a field (`cache_key`, `tools_ttl`, `system_prompt_ttl`, …)
     that maps onto something we do manually?
   - Any new Bedrock model family with prompt caching? Confirm which API surface
     serves it — GPT-5.6 caches **only** over the Responses API, and the same model
     over Converse caches not at all. Then **measure it, don't read it**:

         cd backend
         AWS_PROFILE=dev-ai uv run python scripts/probe_bedrock_cache_point_support.py \
             --model-id <the new model id>

     One command, ~$0.01, and it answers both layers at once — what the pinned
     Strands emits for that id, and whether Bedrock accepts and honors an explicit
     cachePoint. A row where Bedrock caches but `_cache_strategy` is `None` is a
     coverage finding (ii) — file it. Use `--offline-only` for a free check of the
     SDK half alone after a pin bump.
   - Movement on #3546 / #4617 / #4618, and whether #4193 has reached a release.
     All of them change what our cost math may assume.

   ⚠️ Never adopt an upstream caching default on inspection alone. This stack has
   already shipped one caching change whose premise was wrong and cost ~57% more
   in a live measurement. `backend/scripts/probe_gpt56_cache_rates.py` is the gate:
   beat the current arm, measured, before switching.

   ⚠️ **A caching A/B measures nothing if its prefix is under the model's minimum.**
   Below that floor Bedrock **silently ignores** the cache point — no error, no
   cache buckets, a result indistinguishable from "unsupported". Measured on Haiku
   4.5 in us-west-2 (2026-09-11): 2,351 and 3,911 tokens wrote **nothing**, 5,202
   wrote in full — a real floor of **4,096**, twice the 2,048 the first-party
   Anthropic docs publish for Haiku. Do not trust a vendor-documented minimum;
   bracket it. This already produced one false "does not cache" against our own
   production model.

3. **Reference repo — `aws-samples/sample-strands-agent-with-agentcore`**
   - https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-strands-agent-with-agentcore/commits/main
   - Diff the last 7 days (or "since last research run" — whichever is longer). Identify new patterns, removed approaches, or fixes that map to constructs in this repo: agent setup, tool registration, AgentCore Identity flows, Memory configuration, Gateway/MCP wiring.
   - This repo has historically informed our architecture; week-over-week deltas are first-class signal.

   - MCP registry / awesome-mcp lists for new servers relevant to the stack (Bedrock, AWS, GitHub, Slack, observability).

4a. **FastMCP** — used by our externally hosted MCP servers (Lambda-backed, behind AgentCore Gateway). FastMCP is **not** pinned in this repo's `pyproject.toml`; it lives in the MCP server repos this stack consumes via Gateway. Track upstream releases because changes affect server behavior we depend on.
   - https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases
   - https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

   - Identify: breaking changes, new server-side primitives (resources/prompts/tool decorators, lifespan, auth helpers), transport changes (especially relevant if MCP SEP-2567 sessionless transport lands), and Lambda/runtime adapter changes.

4b. **Agentic UI/UX patterns** — emerging UI and UX conventions for AI/agentic apps. We're Angular + Tailwind, so React-specific libraries are **pattern-only** references (extract the idea, implement in signals). Focus on functionality + interaction + visual conventions, not generic "good chat UX".
   - **MCP Apps + extensions** (priority): https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview, https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps, https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io. The "MCP server returns an interactive UI inline with the chat" standard. Track host adoption (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, VS Code Copilot, Goose, Postman) and new MCP extension SEPs.
   - **AI SDK / Generative UI** (Vercel): https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui, https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook. Canonical reference for tool-call rendering, multi-step UI, generative UI, streaming state patterns. React, but the patterns port.
   - **assistant-ui**: https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs, https://github.com/Yonom/assistant-ui/releases. React component library purpose-built for AI chat UI. Tracks attachment UX, threading, tool-call rendering primitives.
   - **Vendor product-blog UX writeups**: https://linear.app/blog (Linear Agent), https://www.cursor.com/blog (canvas, agent harness), https://www.anthropic.com/news filtered for `artifact`/`ui`/`design`. Where in-app agentic patterns get documented by the teams shipping them.

   - **Nielsen Norman Group AI articles**: https://www.nngroup.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/. UX-research perspective; evidence-based; slow cadence — surfaces in ~1 of 4 weekly runs but high signal when it does.
   - Identify: new agentic UI standards (especially MCP Apps + adjacent SEPs), tool-result rendering patterns, attachment/preview UX, multi-agent attribution patterns, consent/elicitation UX, evidence-based usability findings.

5. **Frontier model announcements**
   - https://www.anthropic.com/news
   - https://openai.com/blog (filter: API, agents, tools)
   - https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/ (Gemini)
   - https://ai.meta.com/blog/ (Llama)
   - Focus on capability deltas affecting agent harness design: longer context, native tool use changes, prompt caching APIs, computer use, structured output, latency/cost shifts.

6. **Agent harness patterns**
   - https://www.anthropic.com/engineering (Claude Code, agent design posts)
   - https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
   - LangChain / LlamaIndex / Pydantic-AI release notes — for ideas, not adoption.

6a. **opencode** (`anomalyco/opencode`) — open-source, terminal-native AI coding agent (a Claude Code analog; TypeScript/MIT; very active). Track as a parallel coding-agent-harness reference: how a fast-moving competing harness solves the same problems we face in `backend/src/agents/main_agent/`. Light-touch scan (releases-first); deeper dives only when a release headline maps onto our agent loop, tool layer, or context handling.
   - https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases (primary — read the latest release notes)
   - https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/commits (supplementary — skim recent commits only if a release headline warrants a closer look; confirm the default branch before relying on a path)
   - Web budget: 1–2 requests per week.
   - Identify across the three lenses we track this repo for:
     - **Tooling** — how tools are defined, surfaced, gated/permissioned, and composed; the built-in tool set; tool-call/permission UX; sub-agent / task delegation. *Maps to*: our ToolRegistry, `agents/main_agent/tools/__init__.py`, RBAC/`enabled_tools`, and the multi-protocol tool architecture (direct / AWS SDK / MCP+SigV4 / A2A).
     - **Cost-effectiveness** — model routing and selection, cheap-vs-capable fallback, prompt caching, token-spend controls, anything that lowers per-turn cost. *Maps to*: model selection in `inference_api`, and our caching/compaction story.
     - **Context engineering** — context-window management, compaction/summarization, file/context selection, prompt assembly, retrieval into the window. *Maps to*: our `compaction` SSE event, session/AgentCore-Memory restore, and agent prompt assembly.
   - TypeScript/CLI app, so any UI items are pattern-only references (extract the idea, implement in Angular signals). If a release headlines something material *outside* these three lenses (e.g., a new MCP capability or UX pattern), flag it for the relevant section rather than expanding the opencode scan inline.

7. **AWS Bedrock pricing + quota**
   - https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/
   - Note any model price/quota changes that could shift architecture choices in this repo (e.g., model selection in `inference_api`).

8. **AgentCore SDK / starter-toolkit issues**
   - https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-sdk-python/issues
   - https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit/issues
   - Early-signal bugs/limits other users hit before we do.

9. **Community signal (filtered)**
   - HN search: `site:news.ycombinator.com bedrock OR agentcore OR strands OR "claude code"` (last 7 days)
   - r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning — agent-harness critiques and patterns surface here before vendor blogs.

10. **Anthropic cookbook**
    - https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook
    - Worked examples often outpace docs — especially for caching, tool use, and agent loops.

12. **LibreChat** — open-source ChatGPT-like agentic platform; useful as a parallel-implementation reference cutting across UI/UX, MCP integration, agent/RAG architecture, and provider-routing decisions. Light-touch scan (releases-first); deeper dives only when a release headline maps onto something we're building.
    - https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/releases (primary — read the latest release notes)
    - https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md (supplementary if releases are sparse)
    - Web budget: 1–2 requests per week. If a release headlines something material (new MCP capability, attachment UX, agent harness pattern, OAuth/identity flow, multi-model routing), flag it for the Agentic UI/UX or MCP ecosystem sections rather than expanding the LibreChat scan inline.
    - Identify across four lenses: (a) **UI/UX patterns** — chat UX, attachments, tool-call rendering, agent UI; (b) **comparable-platform choices** — agent harness, RAG, multi-provider routing, feature parity vs this stack; (c) **MCP integration** — how they wire MCP servers, tool routing, OAuth/consent; (d) **release-only signal** — feature ships worth knowing about even if we don't act.
    - React/Node app, so UI items are pattern-only references (extract idea, implement in Angular signals).

11. **Seasonal sources** (only when in window)
    - AWS re:Invent (typically late Nov / early Dec) — Bedrock/AgentCore announcements.
    - NeurIPS / ICLR / EMNLP agent tracks (when proceedings drop).
    - If today's date is not in a known window, skip with "no seasonal sources this week".

### Internal (this repo)

13. **Recent commits.** `git log develop --since="7 days ago" --oneline --no-merges`. Cluster by area (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `infrastructure/`). Reverts and high-churn files signal pain points.

14. **Open PRs + review comments.** `gh pr list --base develop --state open --limit 20`, then `gh pr view <n> --comments` on the top 3 by comment count. Repeated review feedback is a CLAUDE.md or skill-update signal.

15. **GitHub issues opened in last 7 days.** `gh issue list --state open --search "created:>$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)"`. Bug clustering = refactor signal.

16. **CI failures.** `gh run list --status=failure --limit 30`. Group by workflow + job. Flaky tests and recurring infra failures.

17. **Recent CHANGELOG.md / RELEASE_NOTES.md entries** (last 14 days). Used as the "don't re-propose what we just shipped" filter.

18. **Skill inventory.** `find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md -exec stat -f "%Sm %N" {} \;`. Skills not modified in 60+ days and not visibly referenced in recent PRs are retirement candidates.

19. **Version-pin lag.** For each tracked dep, fetch latest release version and compute lag:
    - Backend: `strands-agents`, `boto3`, `botocore`, `fastapi`, `pydantic`, `bedrock-agentcore`, `mcp`
    - Frontend: `@angular/core`, `@analogjs/platform`, `vitest`
    - Infrastructure: `aws-cdk-lib`, `constructs`
    - Source files: `backend/pyproject.toml`, `frontend/ai.client/package.json`, `infrastructure/package.json`.

20. **Decisions log** — `docs/kaizen/decisions.md` (if it exists). Items previously declined; don't re-propose without materially new context.

### 2. Handoff — `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md` (rolling, not dated)

The explicit contract with `kaizen-review-prep`. This skill **appends** new entries under `## Open`. It never edits `## Resolved` (review-prep does the move).

```markdown
# Kaizen Review Queue

Items added by `kaizen-research`, consumed by `kaizen-review-prep`.

<!-- kaizen-review-prep moves entries here after a review. -->

### [YYYY-MM-DD] [Idea title]

```

## How to run

1. **Bootstrap.** If `docs/kaizen/`, `docs/kaizen/research/`, `docs/kaizen/reviews/`, or `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md` don't exist, create them. The queue starts with the headers above and empty sections.

2. **Read recent context** (sequential — small reads):
   - Last 1-2 files in `docs/kaizen/research/`
   - Last 1-2 files in `docs/kaizen/reviews/`
   - `docs/kaizen/decisions.md` if present
   - `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md`
   - Last 14 days of `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

3. **Inventory internal signals** (parallel Bash calls):
   - `git log develop --since="7 days ago" --oneline --no-merges`
   - `gh pr list --base develop --state open --limit 20`
   - `gh issue list --state open --search "created:>$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)"`
   - `gh run list --status=failure --limit 30`
   - `find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md -exec stat -f "%Sm %N" {} \;`
   - Read pinned versions from the three manifest files.

4. **Fan out external scan** — spawn parallel `general-purpose` subagents (or `Explore` for sources requiring multiple targeted lookups). One subagent per source category 1–12 above (15 categories total including 4a FastMCP, 4b Agentic UI/UX, 6a opencode, and 12 LibreChat). LibreChat and opencode each get a *light* subagent — releases-first, 1–2 web requests; do not fan either out further unless a headline maps onto something we're shipping. Each subagent receives:
   - The exact URLs to scan
   - Scope: last 7 days
   - Web budget for that subagent (3–5 requests soft target)
   - Required output: 3-5 bullet items max — title, 1-2 sentence summary, URL, "relevance to this repo" line.
   - **Required**: cite URLs; never fabricate. If empty, return "no notable items this week".

   Total budget across subagents targets ≤50. Track centrally; modest overage (~60) is acceptable when surfacing real signal — beyond that, stop and document the skip.

5. **Version-pin diff.** For each tracked dep, fetch latest release version (WebFetch on the release page or registry equivalent — counts toward budget). Compute lag in releases and days. If a budget hit prevents a check, list the dep under "Skipped".

6. **Synthesize.** Write the research doc per the shape above. Pull subagent reports verbatim into source sections; write the gestalt narrative (TL;DR, "What's moving", Take) yourself. **Top 5 weighting**:
   - **Library-native subtraction** opportunities (where upstream closed a custom-code need) get a subtraction boost.
   - **Capability-unlock** items — new platform primitives, SDK hooks, spec capabilities, or UX patterns that enable net-new product surface we couldn't easily build before — rank on their strategic merit, *not* deprioritized just because they don't intersect existing code. Apply the dual lens from Philosophy: if a feature genuinely unlocks new capability (code-interpreter, persistent agent state, multi-agent UI attribution, etc.), rank it like a fit item, not like a "monitor" item. Resist the temptation to hedge unlock items into "replaces future glue we haven't written" — that under-weights the real story.
   - **Concrete fit** UI/UX patterns that match an existing surface (tool-call rendering, attachments, A2A attribution, consent flows) get a fit boost over generic "interesting trend" items.

7. **Update review queue.** For each Top 5 idea, prepend a new entry under `## Open` in `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md`. Never touch `## Resolved`.

8. **Open a PR** — see "PR creation".

## PR creation

```bash
DATE=$(TZ=America/Denver date +'%Y-%m-%d')
BRANCH="kaizen/research-${DATE}"

git checkout -b "$BRANCH" develop
git add docs/kaizen/
git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
chore(kaizen): weekly research scan ${DATE}

Generated by the kaizen-research skill. Top 5 ideas appended to
docs/kaizen/review-queue.md for the kaizen-review-prep run later this morning.
EOF
)"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"

gh pr create --base develop --head "$BRANCH" \
  --title "chore(kaizen): weekly research scan ${DATE}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- External scan: AWS Bedrock/AgentCore, Strands Agents, FastMCP, reference repo, MCP, agentic UI/UX patterns, frontier models, agent-harness patterns, pricing.
- Internal audit: recent commits, open PRs, GitHub issues, CI failures, version-pin lag, retirement candidates.
- Top 5 ideas in the dated research doc and queued in `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md`.

## Review
- Read the research doc.
- Ship, decline or defer individual ideas in their own PRs — a merged PR is the signal `kaizen-review-prep` reads next Friday. Deep analysis belongs in a `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md` entry on the PR branch that produced it, where the next review will find it.

## Decision
Ship the doc to `develop`. Ranking into decisions happens in the kaizen-review-prep PR opened later this morning. Action on individual ideas happens in separate PRs the following week.

```

The branch is one-shot — squash-merging the PR lands the doc on `develop` and the branch can be deleted.

## Rules

- **No fabrication.** If a source is rate-limited or empty, list it as "not scanned" — don't invent content. The Sources Scanned table is auditable.
- **Web budget is a soft target, not a hard cap.** ≤50 requests is the goal. Overage is acceptable when justified by signal (document in the Web Budget block). Don't pad — if a source is empty after one fetch, move on.
- **Subtraction first.** Top 5 should include at least 2 retire/simplify candidates if the system has been running >2 weeks.
- **Concrete, not aspirational.** "Consider Strands hooks" is too vague. "Add a Strands `BeforeToolCall` hook in `backend/src/agents/main_agent/hooks/` to attribute tokens by tool" is actionable.
- **No edits to source code.** This skill only writes under `docs/kaizen/`.
- **Honest about dry weeks.** A quiet week produces a short doc, not a padded one.
- **Don't re-propose declined ideas** without materially new context. Check `docs/kaizen/decisions.md` and recent reviews.
- **Cite everything.** Every external claim has a URL + access date in the Sources Scanned appendix.
- **Don't auto-merge the PR.** Phil reviews and merges Friday morning. Review-prep runs against the unmerged PR's docs — it reads the file from the working tree, not from `develop`.

## Confirmation

After the PR is opened, tell Phil:
1. PR URL.
2. Top 1-2 ideas (title + Effort×Impact).
3. One-sentence Take.
4. Web budget used (N/50 target) and any skipped sources.

Brief. The full doc is on the PR.
