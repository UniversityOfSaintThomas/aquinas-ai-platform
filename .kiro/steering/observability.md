# Observability

Every CloudWatch alarm in `PlatformStack` publishes to one SNS topic. This doc
covers the rules that keep that true, the gotchas that silently break alarms, and
what to do when one fires.

## 0. The failure this system was built to prevent

Before this work the stack had 13 alarms and **not one of them notified anybody**.
Three separate constructs carried a comment saying so. Two of those alarms were
worse than silent: they watched metric names that exist in no CloudWatch
namespace at all, so they sat in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` from the day they were
created — which an operator reads as *healthy*.

Both failures share a shape: **nothing errored.** The alarm deployed, evaluated,
and turned green. Every rule below exists because this domain fails quietly, and
quiet failure has to be caught by structure or by a test, never by remembering.

## 1. Never call `new cloudwatch.Alarm()` — use `AlarmFactory`

```typescript
const alarms = new AlarmFactory(this, config, props.alarmTopic);

alarms.alarm('MyAlarmLogicalId', {
  name: 'my-service-errors',          // NOT alarmName; prefix is applied for you
  alarmDescription: 'What broke, and what the first response should be',
  metric: someMetric,
  threshold: config.observability.someThreshold,
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
  comparisonOperator: cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator.GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD,
  treatMissingData: cloudwatch.TreatMissingData.NOT_BREACHING,
});
```

The factory attaches both `AlarmActions` and `OKActions` as a consequence of
being used at all. `new cloudwatch.Alarm()` produces a console-only alarm that
looks completely finished, which is why the rule is enforced by a source-level
test rather than convention:

- `observability-alarm-routing.test.ts` fails if any file under `lib/` calls the
  constructor directly (except the factory itself), and fails if any alarm in the
  synthesized template lacks actions.

Use `expressionAlarm()` for metric math so the routing guarantee survives.

## 2. No `config.production` in observability code

This repo is forked by many institutions. A fork with one environment should not
have to reason about a `production` boolean, and a fork with three should not be
limited to two. Every tunable is a **single scalar** in `ObservabilityConfig`,
and per-environment differences live in the forker's own deployment config
(GitHub Variables scoped to a GitHub Environment) — not in a ternary here.

Enforced: `observability-alarm-routing.test.ts` fails on any `config.production`
under `lib/constructs/observability/`.

Adding a tunable means touching five places. Miss the third and the flag is
accepted then silently ignored:

1. `OBSERVABILITY_DEFAULT_*` constant in `config.ts`, with the reasoning inline
2. field on `ObservabilityConfig`
3. loader entry using the full precedence chain (see §3)
4. `scripts/common/load-env.sh` → `build_cdk_context_params()`
5. job-level `env:` in `.github/workflows/platform.yml`

Defaults are **cost-conscious**: they are what a fork inherits when it configures
nothing, so they are the cheapest setting that still leaves alerting useful.
Diagnostic depth is opt-in. The X-Ray sampling default is the clearest case — it
was `1.0` for any fork that never set `production`, meaning a recorded trace for
every single agent invocation at $5/million.

## 3. The flat dotted context key (this has bitten the repo three times)

`--context observability.logRetentionDays=90` sets the **flat** key
`context['observability.logRetentionDays']`. It does **not** build a nested
object. Reading only the nested form accepts the operator's flag and ignores it.

```typescript
logRetentionDays:
  parseIntEnv(process.env.CDK_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS)
  ?? parseIntEnv(scope.node.tryGetContext('observability.logRetentionDays'))  // ← flat
  ?? scope.node.tryGetContext('observability')?.logRetentionDays              // ← nested
  ?? OBSERVABILITY_DEFAULT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS,
```

Use `parseFloatEnv` for fractional values. `parseIntEnv('0.05')` is `0`, which
would switch X-Ray sampling off entirely rather than setting it to 5%.

## 4. Gotchas that produce silently-broken alarms

### The SNS topic must use a customer-managed KMS key

CloudWatch **cannot** publish to a topic encrypted with the AWS-managed
`alias/aws/sns` key: the publish is made by the `cloudwatch.amazonaws.com`
service principal, and an AWS-managed key's policy cannot be edited to grant it
`kms:GenerateDataKey*`. The alarm goes to ALARM, the console shows it firing, and
the notification is dropped.

`kms:Decrypt` alone is **not enough** — SNS envelope encryption has the
*publisher* generate the data key, so `GenerateDataKey*` is required too.

### Dimensions must come from real resources

A `CPUUtilization` alarm with no dimensions is a valid CloudWatch alarm that
silently averages every ECS service in the account. Same for ALB metrics. Always
derive dimensions from the CDK resource (`service.metricCpuUtilization()`,
`targetGroup.metrics.*`, `table.metric()`), never from a name string.

### Metric-math alarms cap at 10 metrics

CloudWatch rejects an alarm whose math expression contains more than 10
individual metrics. CDK's `table.metricSystemErrorsForOperations()` defaults to
**all 14** DynamoDB operations and throws `TooManyMetricsInMathExpression` at
synth. Pass an explicit operations list.

Also: CDK deprecates `metricThrottledRequests()` and `metricSystemErrors()` as
returning invalid metrics. Use `table.metric('ReadThrottleEvents')` etc.

### Don't pass `label` to a metric used in an alarm

It forces CDK to render the alarm as a `Metrics[]` array instead of flat
`Namespace`/`MetricName`/`ExtendedStatistic` properties. CloudWatch labels
percentile series adequately on its own.

### Units differ between services

| Metric | Unit | Threshold handling |
|---|---|---|
| AgentCore `Latency` | **Milliseconds** | use `agentCoreLatencyMs` directly |
| ALB `TargetResponseTime` | **Seconds** | divide by 1000 |

Both verified with `get-metric-statistics`. Getting this wrong is a 1000x error
in either direction, and neither direction fails loudly.

## 5. Streaming makes latency a weak signal

The chat path is SSE. The ALB does not consider a request complete until the
stream closes, so `TargetResponseTime` and AgentCore `Latency` are legitimately
tens of seconds for a healthy turn — and a sudden *drop* can mean turns are
failing early.

Measured over 14 days in dev: average turn **3.0–4.5s**, daily maxima **16.7s,
16.9s, 24.4s**. The original alarm threshold was 30s, i.e. *below* the observed
maximum, so a healthy long turn could trip it. Latency floors default to 120s.

Reliable signals on this path are the discrete ones: 5xx counts, unhealthy hosts,
rejected connections, throttles.

## 6. `treatMissingData` is a per-metric decision

Never defaulted by the factory, because both answers are correct somewhere:

- **`NOT_BREACHING`** for error and throttle counts. A service that is not
  failing publishes nothing, so absent data is the healthy state.
- **`BREACHING`** for `UnHealthyHostCount` and `RunningTaskCount`. These stop
  being published when the service is at zero or deleted. `NOT_BREACHING` would
  leave the alarm silent during a total outage — the exact case it exists for.

## 7. Verify metrics exist before alarming on them

Documentation is not sufficient evidence that a metric is published, and an alarm
on a non-existent metric is indistinguishable from a healthy one.

```bash
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore" \
  | jq -r '.Metrics | group_by(.MetricName) | .[] |
      "\(.[0].MetricName) dims=\(map(.Dimensions|map(.Name)|sort)|unique|tostring)"'
```

Known facts from that sweep, all pinned by tests:

- Runtime metrics live in `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore` (hyphenated), dimensioned
  `Resource` + `Operation=InvokeAgentRuntime` + `Name={runtimeName}::DEFAULT`.
  The lowercase `bedrock-agentcore` namespace is real but holds only the
  OpenTelemetry/Strands *application* metrics.
- **Memory and Gateway publish `Resource` as a full ARN; Code Interpreter
  publishes a bare ID.** Passing an ARN for Code Interpreter yields an alarm that
  matches nothing.
- `AWS/Cognito` on the **ESSENTIALS** feature plan publishes *only* success
  metrics. There is no sign-in failure or throttle metric to alarm on — failure
  and threat metrics require the **Plus** plan. The auth-path failure signal is
  the token-enrichment Lambda's `Errors` metric instead.
- AgentCore Browser has zero metric streams (provisioned, unused).

A metric absent from `list-metrics` may simply never have fired. Alarming on it
is still correct — `NOT_BREACHING` keeps it quiet until the first occurrence.

## 8. Resource budget

CloudFormation caps a stack at **500 resources**, and this is a deliberate
single-stack architecture with nowhere to spill. Alarms are the largest
discretionary consumer.

Measured: **308** resources before this work, **~370** after. A guard in
`observability-dynamodb-alarms.test.ts` fails the build above 460, so the ceiling
surfaces while there is still room to react rather than as a failed deploy.

When budget matters, decide with data rather than by covering every documented
metric. The DynamoDB allocation was cut from 78 alarms to 27 because a live sweep
showed `ReadThrottleEvents`, `WriteThrottleEvents` and `SystemErrors` had **zero
streams** — all tables are on-demand, so throttling had never occurred — while
account-level `UserErrors` had real data nobody was watching.

Dashboards: the first **3 are free**, then $3/month each. The stack is at exactly
3, which is why the platform dashboard links to the other two instead of
restating their widgets.

## 9. Log retention

One value, `observability.logRetentionDays`, applied through
`logRetentionFor(config)`. A source guard fails the build if any construct
hardcodes `retention: logs.RetentionDays.*`.

The AgentCore Runtime's log group is created by the **AgentCore service**, not
CloudFormation, so a CDK `LogGroup` cannot set its retention — declaring one
would collide on create or manage a second, empty group. An `AwsCustomResource`
calls `logs:PutRetentionPolicy` instead. That API is idempotent but does **not**
create the group: on a missing group it returns `ResourceNotFoundException` and
creates nothing. The Runtime's own execution role creates the group on its first
container start, and on every deploy observed so far that has landed well before
the custom resource runs. If it ever loses that race, a thrown error would fail
the custom resource and roll back the whole stack update, so both calls set
`ignoreErrorCodesMatching: 'ResourceNotFoundException'` and the daily sweep
below sets retention within a day. With the sweep turned off there is no such
backstop: the group keeps no retention until CloudFormation re-runs the call
(only when the retention value or the Runtime id changes), so set it by hand.
Calling `CreateLogGroup` first was rejected: it would race the Runtime's own
create the other way round. There is deliberately **no `onDelete`**: removing
the retention policy on teardown would revert the group to "keep forever", which
is the cost problem it fixes.

**The replacement trap.** That custom resource only ever sees the *current*
Runtime. Replacing a Runtime gives it a new id and a new group
(`<runtime-name>-<new-id>-DEFAULT`); the old group drops out of CDK's view and
keeps whatever retention it had. Groups orphaned before the custom resource
existed have none, so they never expire, and they hold conversation text. A
landing zone that stamps a default retention on every `CreateLogGroup` event
can also overwrite the deploy-time value a few minutes later, even on the live
group. `RuntimeLogRetentionSweepConstruct` closes both gaps: a daily Lambda
lowers every group under `/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/<runtime-name>-` to
`logRetentionDays` when its retention is unset or longer. Runtime names cannot
contain `-`, so that prefix covers every generation of this deployment's Runtime
and no other deployment's. It never deletes a group; removing an orphaned group
is an operator's call. Kill switch:
`CDK_OBSERVABILITY_RUNTIME_LOG_RETENTION_SWEEP_ENABLED=false`, for an account
whose governance requires longer retention. Turning it off also removes the
backstop for a live group the deploy-time call found missing. Groups from an
older naming scheme (a different runtime name) are outside the prefix and need a
one-off `put-retention-policy`.

## 10. Subscriptions are not infrastructure-as-code

The topic is created by CDK; **subscribers are not**. Several teams need to hear
about failures and their membership changes far more often than the
infrastructure does. Requiring a PR, a review, and a CloudFormation deploy to add
one address is how a notification list goes stale and stops being trusted.

```bash
TOPIC=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/${PREFIX}/observability/alarm-topic-arn" \
  --query Parameter.Value --output text)
aws sns subscribe --topic-arn "$TOPIC" \
  --protocol email --notification-endpoint team@example.edu
```

A test asserts zero `AWS::SNS::Subscription` resources exist, so this decision
cannot be quietly reversed.

## 11. Runbook — first response by alarm

| Alarm | What it means | First action |
|---|---|---|
| `alb-unhealthy-hosts` | Targets failing health checks, **or none reporting** | `aws ecs describe-services` — are tasks running at all? Then app-api logs. |
| `alb-elb-5xx` | The load balancer itself could not serve | Almost always no healthy target. Check the alarm above first. |
| `alb-target-5xx` | App is reachable and erroring | app-api logs. This is application code. |
| `alb-rejected-connections` | ALB connection limit hit | Users were turned away *before* reaching the app, so nothing is in app logs. Check request volume. |
| `app-api-running-tasks-low` | Fewer tasks than desired | Task failing to start: check stopped-task reason, image pull, subnet IPs. |
| `app-api-memory-high` | Sustained memory pressure | Fargate **kills** a task that exhausts memory. Raise memory or find the leak. |
| `agentcore-system-errors` | AgentCore's fault | Escalate to AWS. Not application code. |
| `agentcore-high-error-rate` | `UserErrors` — our requests are malformed | Recent inference-api deploy? Check payload shape and IAM. |
| `agentcore-throttles` | At the TPS or session quota | Request a quota increase. Will not self-resolve. |
| `agentcore-high-latency` | p99 above 120s | Genuinely hung, not merely slow — 24s is a normal maximum here. |
| `agentcore-runtime-active-sessions` | Concurrent Runtime sessions accumulating **for a sustained hour** | **Cost before capacity** — Runtime bills memory for whole session lifetime, and there is no AWS API to terminate a session. Check mean microVM life in the Runtime log group's `/ping` access lines: 20–50 min is healthy, hours means idle reaping has regressed (see #827). ⚠️ Do **not** respond by raising the threshold: measured on 7 days of prod, load-test bursts still fire it at 500 and only go quiet near 1500, which is above the ~99-sustained #338 regime the alarm exists to catch. The 12-period (1 hour) window is what separates the two — a burst under an hour should never have paged you, so if this fired, something stayed up for a full hour. |
| `bedrock-tpm-quota-usage-<model>` | **Leading** indicator | First confirm the configured quota still matches Service Quotas — it is set by hand and nothing checks it. If current, request an increase *now*, before throttling starts. |
| `bedrock-invocation-throttles` | At a model's TPM/RPM quota | Users see chats that never respond. Quota increase. |
| `agentcore-memory-*` | Memory hot path failing | Users experience an agent that has forgotten the conversation. |
| `agentcore-gateway-*` | MCP calls failing at the gateway | Agents lose tool access. Check gateway targets. |
| `ddb-*-throttle` | Named table throttling | On-demand, so this is a hot partition or an account limit. Compare `ReadThrottleEvents` vs `WriteThrottleEvents` on that table. |
| `ddb-user-errors` | DynamoDB rejecting our requests (4xx) | Application code misusing the API. Account-wide, so use CloudTrail or app logs to find the caller. |
| `lambda-token-enrichment-errors` | **Silent** degradation | Handler is fail-open: logins still work, but MCP tools are losing user-identity claims. |
| `dlq-kb-ingestion-not-empty` | Work accepted then failed every retry | Will **not** self-clear. Inspect, fix, then replay or drain. |
| `prompt-cache-session-partial-miss` | One conversation re-writing its prefix every turn | Use the "Sessions by partial-miss waste" widget to find which session. |

Start at the **`{prefix}-platform-health`** dashboard: row 1 says whether traffic
is being served, row 2 says why, row 3 shows every alarm's current state.

## 12. Boise State's own profile

The committed defaults are what a **fork** should inherit. Boise State authors
this platform and does far more diagnostic work than any deployer of it, so our
values differ — and they live in GitHub Variables scoped to a GitHub Environment,
never in committed code. That separation is what lets both be right at once.

`scripts/observability/set-bsu-overrides.sh --env <development|production>`
applies them. It is **not run by CI**, makes no AWS changes, and requires
confirmation, because it mutates shared repository configuration. Add `--dry-run`
to print the plan (no `gh` auth needed).

| Field | OSS default | BSU dev | BSU prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xraySamplingRate` | `0.01` | `0.5` | `0.1` |
| `xraySamplingReservoir` | `1` | `5` | `2` |
| `xrayInsightsNotifications` | `false` | `true` | `true` |
| `agentCoreApplicationLogsEnabled` | `false` | `true` | **`false`** |
| `logRetentionDays` | `30` | `14` | `90` |
| `agentCoreErrorThreshold` | `10` | `5` | `5` |
| `lambdaErrorThreshold` | `5` | `1` | `3` |
| `albTarget5xxThreshold` | `10` | `5` | `5` |
| `dynamoThrottleThreshold` | `10` | `1` | default |
| `ecsCpuPercent` / `ecsMemoryPercent` | `80` / `85` | default | `75` / `80` |
| `promptCacheAvoidableMissThreshold` | `10` | `5` | default |
| `promptCacheWastedUsdThreshold` | `1` | `0.5` | default |

Two choices worth understanding rather than copying:

- **Dev traces at 50%, prod at 10%.** Not a mistake. X-Ray bills per trace
  recorded, and prod traffic is orders of magnitude larger, so 10% of prod is far
  more traces than 50% of dev. Dev is where we debug; prod is where we pay.
- **`agentCoreApplicationLogsEnabled` stays OFF in production.** Those records
  carry every user's prompt and the model's response verbatim — the
  highest-volume log source available and a genuine PII surface. Enable it
  temporarily for a specific investigation, then turn it back off.

Retention inverts between the two for the same reason latency floors are high:
dev keeps 14 days because dev noise is not worth a month, prod keeps 90 because a
real incident review reaches back weeks.

**Verifying a variable took effect.** The synth log prints a line beginning
`Observability:` with the *resolved* values. If it disagrees with the variable you
set, the value is not reaching `--context` — check the deploy job's **job-level**
`env:` block, since `vars.*` in a workflow-level `env:` silently resolves to an
empty string.
