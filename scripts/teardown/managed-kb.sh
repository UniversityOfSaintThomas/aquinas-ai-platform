# Teardown - Delete runtime-created Managed Knowledge Bases
#
# Requirements 20.8, 13.4, 13.5 of .kiro/specs/managed-kb-migration.
#
# Managed knowledge bases are created at RUNTIME by the provisioning
# saga, not by CloudFormation. They are therefore not children of any
# stack and `delete-stack` does not touch them: left alone they survive
# the teardown, keep billing at $5.00/GB-month, and are invisible to
# anyone reading the CloudFormation console.
#
# Ordering is not cosmetic. This runs BEFORE the stacks come down,
# because the Bedrock service role lives in PlatformStack and Bedrock
# needs it to delete a knowledge base. Deleting the role first is a
# plausible route into DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL, which is a real terminal
# state — the dev account has held a knowledge base stuck in it since
# 2025-11-24 — and it cannot be cleared by retrying.
#
# Scope is by TAG, never by name pattern. Two environments share an
# account, and a name prefix is a convention while a tag is what the
# reconciler and this script both read (Requirement 20.11).
#
# Exits non-zero if any matched knowledge base is not confirmed absent,
# so the caller does not proceed to delete the role out from under it
# (Requirement 13.5).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/teardown/managed-kb.sh
