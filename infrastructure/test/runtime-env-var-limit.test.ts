/**
 * `AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Runtime` env-var ceiling guard.
 *
 * The Runtime resource accepts at most **50** EnvironmentVariables. That limit
 * is enforced by CloudFormation when it validates the changeset — *not* by
 * `cdk synth`, and not by anything else that runs before a deploy. So a PR that
 * adds the 51st variable passes `tsc`, passes `jest`, passes CI, merges, and
 * then fails the Platform Stack deploy with:
 *
 *     🛑 #/EnvironmentVariables: maximum size: [50], found: [51]
 *
 * That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-05: #833 PR-5 added
 * `QUOTA_RUNWAY_ENABLED` to the inference construct and broke the dev platform
 * deploy. Nothing caught it earlier because nothing looked.
 *
 * This test looks. It is deliberately a *ceiling* assertion rather than an
 * exact-count snapshot: removing a variable should never fail a build, and
 * pinning the exact number would turn every legitimate removal into a test
 * edit. The failure message is the important part — it has to tell the next
 * person what to do, because "add an env var" is an obvious-looking change with
 * a non-obvious limit.
 *
 * Freeing a slot means retiring a dead variable or folding several booleans
 * into one delimited value. A code-level feature flag that reads `os.environ`
 * and defaults ON does not need an entry here at all.
