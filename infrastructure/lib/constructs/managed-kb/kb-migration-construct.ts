/**
 * KbMigrationConstruct — the Managed_KB migration control plane
 * (.kiro/specs/managed-kb-migration, tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5).
 *
 * FOUR DockerImage Lambdas sharing ONE image
 * (`backend/Dockerfile.kb-migration`) with different
 * `ImageConfig.Command` overrides:
 *   - dispatcher — EventBridge tick; sweeps the sparse `KbWorkIndex`,
 *     applies a bounded per-tick dispatch limit, invokes the worker.
 *     No-ops entirely when the migration flag is off (Req 19.6).
 *   - worker — runs one knowledge base through
 *     `shadow → verify → promote → retain` under a lease (Req 15).
 *   - reconciler — daily tag-filtered `ListKnowledgeBases` joined
 *     against KB_Records (Req 14). Ships DISARMED: it reports intended
 *     deletions and deletes nothing.
 *   - document reconciler — nightly join of Bedrock's per-document view
 *     against non-terminal DOC# rows (task 16.5, §5.37). The second
 *     writer the ingestion consumer's dead-letter path never had. Ships
 *     DISARMED: it reports intended corrections and writes nothing.
 *   - ingestion consumer — durable, retryable replacement for the
 *     in-process `asyncio.ensure_future` orchestration, routing each
 *     uploaded document to the legacy pipeline or to Direct_Ingestion
 *     according to its knowledge base's engine (Req 10).
 *
 * ONE IMAGE, FIVE FUNCTIONS. Every function points
 * `fromImageAsset` at the SAME byte-stable `bootstrap-assets/kb-migration/`
 * directory, so CDK emits a single image asset and the platform deploy
 * pushes one image rather than five. The per-function difference is the
 * `cmd` override, which lands in `ImageConfig.Command` — function
 * *configuration*, not code. That distinction is what makes the
 * platform-as-bootstrap pattern work here: the backend workflow's
 * out-of-band `aws lambda update-function-code --image-uri` swaps the
 * image and never touches the command, and the override paths are valid
 * in both the stub and the real image.
 *
 * `backend/Dockerfile.kb-migration` DOES NOT EXIST YET, and that is
 * deliberate. CDK's only build input is the bootstrap directory above;
 * the real image is a *workflow* artefact, and it cannot be built before
 * the handler modules it COPYs exist (task groups 9, 10 and 13). Creating
 * it now would produce a Dockerfile that COPYs absent paths — unbuildable,
 * unregistered in `scripts/build/build-one.sh`, and unreferenced by any
 * `backend.yml` job. It arrives with the handlers, exactly as
 * `backend/Dockerfile.kb-sync` did, together with its build-one.sh case,
 * its build/deploy jobs, and its entries in the supply-chain
 * dockerfile-pinning and Lambda-import-closure tests.
 *
 * DARK BY DEFAULT. All three flags ship off (Req 19.5), and the
 * construct is inert in that state:
 *   - the dispatcher's rule is created DISABLED, and the dispatcher also
 *     gates on its own `MANAGED_KB_MIGRATION_ENABLED` env var, so an
 *     operator can dark-stop migration via CFN or a plain env flip;
 *   - the ingestion consumer's trigger rule is created DISABLED (see the
 *     long note on that rule — it must stay disabled while the legacy
 *     pipeline owns the S3 event, or every upload would be ingested
 *     twice);
 *   - the reconciler's rule is deliberately ENABLED. That is not an
 *     oversight. Requirement 14.7 makes report-only the initial deployed
 *     mode precisely so its judgement can be reviewed against weeks of
 *     real data before `reconcilerArmed` lets it delete anything.
 *     Report-only is read-only, so an enabled schedule changes nothing.
 *
 * Additive by construction: this construct creates only new resources.
 * The one thing it needs from the existing world — S3 `ObjectCreated`
 * events — it takes over EventBridge rather than by editing the
 * documents bucket's existing Lambda notification (see the rule's note).
 *
 * SSM publications (consumed by the backend workflow's code-deploy):
 *   /{prefix}/kb-migration/dispatcher-function-name
 *   /{prefix}/kb-migration/worker-function-name
 *   /{prefix}/kb-migration/reconciler-function-name

    // ── Documents-bucket ObjectCreated trigger (task 2.2) ──

    // WHY EVENTBRIDGE AND NOT A SECOND BUCKET NOTIFICATION.
    // The documents bucket already has an `s3:ObjectCreated:*`
    // notification with prefix `assistants/` pointing at the legacy
    // rag-ingestion Lambda. S3 REJECTS a notification configuration that
    // has overlapping prefixes for the same event type — "your
    // notification configurations that use Filter can't define filtering
    // rules with overlapping prefixes ... for the same event types", and
    // an identical prefix is the maximally overlapping case. So a second
    // `addEventNotification(OBJECT_CREATED, ..., { prefix: 'assistants/' })`
    // does not coexist with the first; it makes
    // PutBucketNotificationConfiguration fail and takes the deploy down.
    // The only ways to put two Lambdas behind one S3 event are to replace
    // the existing destination with a fan-out (which mutates live
    // behaviour and would drop the current subscription) or to route
    // through EventBridge, which is a SEPARATE field of the bucket's
    // notification configuration and therefore purely additive to the
    // existing LambdaFunctionConfigurations.
    //
    // WHY THE RULE SHIPS DISABLED.
    // While the legacy pipeline still owns the S3 event, having both
    // triggers live would hand every upload to both consumers — and this
    // consumer routes a legacy document straight back into the legacy
    // pipeline, so the document would be ingested TWICE
    // (Requirement 10.5). It is enabled once either managed creation or a
    // migration is on, at which point routing is what we want. Note also
    // that a bucket notification has no enabled/disabled switch, so
    // EventBridge is the only trigger primitive that can be dark-shipped
    // at all — a second reason it is the right one here.
    //
    // `enableEventBridgeNotification()` on the bucket is called by the
    // parent stack, not here: this construct never mutates a bucket
    // passed in as a prop, the same discipline the rag-ingestion
    // construct documents for `addEventNotification`.
