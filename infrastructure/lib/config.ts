 * - `reconcilerArmed` (MANAGED_KB_RECONCILER_ARMED) — whether the daily
 *   Reconciler DELETES orphans or merely logs what it would have
 *   deleted. This is the inverted-convention flag: the Reconciler is
 *   *deployed and running* from day one but *disarmed*, so its

 *   allowed to delete anything (Requirements 14.7, 19.7). Note the

 * AgentCore Gateway configuration.

 * SigV4 or JWT" mode. Outbound credentials remain per-target, so a single
 * Gateway still serves both IAM-invoked Lambda targets and OAuth/token-exchange
 * targets.
 *
 * ## The authorizer is immutable after creation
 *
 * Changing this value on an **existing** Gateway does not work. The AgentCore
 * control plane rejects it:
 *
 * ```
 * Authorizer type cannot be updated for an existing gateway
 * (Service: BedrockAgentCoreControl, Status Code: 400)
 * ```
 *
 * This is *not* visible from CloudFormation: the resource schema documents both

 * in-place `[~]` modify. Both reflect CFN's model, not the service's validation.
 * The failure only surfaces at deploy time, mid-update.

 * This is a **cost** alarm, not a quota alarm. The us-west-2 default runtime
 * quota is 5,000 concurrent sessions, so 75 is 1.5% of it — `agentcore-throttles`
 * is still the signal for actual quota exhaustion. What this watches is session
 * *accumulation*, because Runtime bills memory for a session's whole lifetime,
 * not for compute time, and AWS offers no API to list or force-terminate an
 * active runtime session (aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit#498).
 *
 * Calibrated against this repo's own incident. While the `/ping` reaper bug of
 * #338 was live, July 2026 burned 71,954 microVM-hours — an average of ~99
 * concurrent sessions sustained across the whole month, weekends and nights
 * included. After #827 restored idle reaping, mean microVM life went from
 * 488-496 min back to 21.5-33.6 min.
 *
 * **Magnitude alone cannot separate a regression from a load test, so the real
 * discriminator is DURATION — see `evaluationPeriods` at the alarm site.**
 * Measured against 7 days of real prod `ActiveSessionCount` (2026-09-04..11),
 * a week that contained three nightly load tests peaking at 241, 608 and 1404:
 *
 * | threshold | window | firings |
 * |-----------|--------|---------|
 * | 200       | 15 min | 3 (every load test) |
 * | 75        | 30 min | 2 |
 * | **75**    | **60 min** | **0** |
 *
 * Raising the threshold does not help: load tests still fire it at 500, and it
 * only goes quiet near 1500 — which is *above* the ~99 regime this alarm exists
 * to catch, so it would then never fire on the real thing. The longest
 * continuous run above 75 that week was 45 min, so a 60-minute window clears
 * every observed load test with 15 min of margin, while a sustained 99 still
 * alarms one hour after onset.
 *
 * Ordinary prod traffic outside those bursts was max 8-16, mean 2.4-6.8; dev
 * peaks at 5. 75 clears both by a wide margin.
